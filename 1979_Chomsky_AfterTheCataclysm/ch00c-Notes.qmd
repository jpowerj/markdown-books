For example, the outstanding study Israel, La fin des mythes (Albin Michel, 1975) by Amnon Kapeliouk, an Israeli journalist who is a regular correspondent for Le Monde, which was unable to find a U.S. publisher; or The Gun and the Olive Branch (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1977) by David Hirst of the Manchester Guardian, published in the United States but virtually ignored. There are many other cases.

Though the context suggests that he was referring to the statist intelligentsia of “the left,” the term and accompanying analysis apply quite generally. See N. Chomsky, Intellectuals and the State, for some discussion of the typical role of those who Bakunin called “the new class” a century ago—a concept that is periodically rediscovered and distorted in ways appropriate to contemporary ideology.

The practice continues. A case recently exposed by the Senate Committee on Intelligence involves the Penkovsky Papers, actually “prepared and written by witting Agency assets who drew on actual case materials” and “sold to a publisher through a trust fund established for the purpose,” the publisher remaining “unaware of any U.S. Government interest.” Cited from the Senate report by Stephen S. Rosenfeld, Washington Post (30 April 1976). Rosenfeld was expelled from Moscow in protest over publication of the CIA fabrication in the Post. The Russians alleged—correctly, as we now discover—that the book was a “coarse fraud, a mixture of provocative invention and anti-Soviet slander” (Rosenfeld). The book’s “editor,” Frank Gibney, pledged that proceeds would go to a fund “to further the cause of genuine peace and friendship between the American and Russian peoples,” which must have caused a few laughs in CIA and KGB circles.






[9](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt9). See Volume I, chapter 5, section 2.2. What is remarkable is not so much that Chi’s account was believed at the time, but that belief persists even after the exposures, as we discussed. See particularly note 168, discussing Guenter Lewy’s parody of scholarship. In this case, the intelligence fabrications may well have deluded the CIA as well. Snepp, who is described on the jacket of his book as “the agency’s principal analyst of North Vietnamese political affairs,” refers to “some 30,000 to 50,000 intransigent peasants and landowners...killed or imprisoned” in the land reform program of the mid-1950s (p. 354). The fact that he offers one of the more restrained estimates suggests, however, that he may be continuing to purvey the myth, rather than expressing his belief in it.

[10](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt10). Portrait of a Cold Warrior, Putnam, 1976. A defense of the CIA, the book is not devoted to an exposure of its practices. Nevertheless, it contains much of interest, including an account of electoral manipulation in the Philippines, the anti-Castro crusade (which, he claims, was being escalated by Kennedy just before his death but was reduced in scale by Johnson), and other matters. As for the more humanitarian aspects of U.S. policy, Smith concludes that “despite the idealistic Alianza para el Progreso prattle, U.S. policy and CIA activities in Latin America were shaped by U.S. business interests and investments.” This conclusion, produced in reference to the CIA’s role in putting Frei into office in Chile in 1964, is interesting because of its source, though hardly novel. (See also Volume I, chapter 2, note 38.)

[12](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt12). See, for example, John K. Fairbank, “Our Vietnam tragedy,” Newsletter, Harvard Graduate Society for Advanced Study and Research, June 1975. He writes that “a factor of ignorance” lies at the source of “our Vietnam tragedy.” We did not realize that the Vietnamese revolution was “inspired by the sentiment of nationalism” and we misguidedly “embarked on an anti-nationalist effort,” and later misconceived “our role in defending the South after 1965,” conceiving it as aimed at blocking aggression from North Vietnam and “forestalling a southward expansion of Chinese Communism.” A judicious scholar, he also remarks that our “greatly accelerating the urbanization of Vietnam” after 1965 was “not necessarily to our credit or to the benefit of the South Vietnamese,” referring to the policy of bombing the population into the cities to destroy the rural society and thus deprive the NLF of its support. See also Edwin O. Reischauer (“Back to Normalcy,” Foreign Policy, Fall, 1975), who also claims that the U.S. government was unaware of the nationalist character of the Viet Minh and its successors: “The real lesson of the Vietnam war is the tremendous cost of attempting to control the destiny of a South-east Asian country against the cross-currents of nationalism”—the cost to us, that is. To thoroughly appreciate the character of this historical nonsense (putting aside its moral level), one must recognize that Fairbank and Reischauer are the “deans” of Asian scholarship, with solid liberal credentials.

[15](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt15). This phrase is the propaganda term, invariably applied by the press and scholarship, to the client regime installed by the United States in South Vietnam; useful in its implication of a positive connection with the population rather than the actuality of a minority instrument of a foreign power.






[16](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt16). On occasion, alert reporters commented on the fabrications. For example, Daniel Southerland cabled from Saigon “that so far he has been unable to verify reports of executions of officials and others in occupied areas. Mr. Southerland does report cables from the U.S. embassy in Saigon to Washington reporting alleged executions, but says one monk supposed to be an eyewitness is nowhere to be found. Another alleged eyewitness in Da Nang told Mr. Southerland he had seen no such thing. The embassy’s cables have the apparent aim of persuading Congress to vote more aid, Mr. Southerland reports.” Interpolated in Godfrey Sperling Jr., “Will Saigon become election issue?” Christian Science Monitor (21 April 1975).






[17](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt17). Snepp, op. cit. pp. 301f. This operation, in which Britain and Australia also played a part, was described by Richard West as a “nauseating charade...this sudden concern for orphans is the most disgusting sham I have witnessed in nine years in Vietnam” (New Statesmen, 11 April 1975). Martin Woollacott described it as “one of the most hideous aspects of these last days of Saigon—the way in which children are suddenly being used as a propaganda weapon...the orphanages of Saigon are now being scoured by people whose only purpose is to make some kind of capital out of the present situation” (Manchester Guardian Weekly, 12 April 1975). The Vatican accused the United States “of engaging in international kidnapping, abusing the children for propagandistic purposes and engaging in a national ‘guilt trip’ to compensate for America’s role in Southeast Asia” (New York Times, 13 April 1975). A group of Buddhist orphanages denounced the “exploitation of the orphans for political aims”; the airlift “has stirred great sympathy among Americans but it has raised a storm of protest in Vietnam itself” (Daniel Southerland, Christian Science Monitor, 23 April 1975). The Red Cross condemned the operation as contrary to the Geneva conventions and the Buddhist An Quang Pagoda called it “a shameful act” (Washington Post, 10 April 1975). Many non-Communists in Saigon called it “a ‘criminal act’ akin to kidnapping,” while the effort of the Daily Mail (London) “to get in on the orphan act” by rounding up orphans was called “a grotesque stunt” (H.D.S. Greenway, Washington Post, 15 April 1978). “...most Vietnamese reacted with anger at the American babylift last week” while Deputy Prime Minister Phan Quang Dan admitted that “it was a good way to get sympathy for additional American aid to Vietnam,” noting that Ambassador Martin had “intervened personally” to send the orphans abroad so as to “help swing American public opinion to the advantage of the Republic of Vietnam” (Fox Butterfield, New York Times, 13 April 1975). Jane Barton, a Vietnamese-speaking staff worker of the AFSC, interviewed children who said that they were not orphans but had been separated from their parents in refugee camps and then flown to the United States. They reported that families were arbitrarily broken up with children sent to different countries; in three visits to orphans arriving in San Francisco she did not meet one child who had lost both parents (AFSC report, 14 April 1975). Desmond Smith, director of CBC TV in Montreal, described the “body snatching” as perhaps the most “revolting” act yet in the war. He quotes a Canadian relief worker who describes it as “like getting meat in a meat market.” He points out further that up to two months before it “was not fashionable” to save real orphans, and also discusses the disgusting spectacle of Americans who would not dream of saving an orphan from a U.S. ghetto or a Calcutta slum but who now just must have a Vietnamese child kidnapped from Saigon: “The final indignity for the Vietnamese is that after we have bombed, strafed, napalmed and maimed half the population, we now take their children from them” (Nation, 19 April 1975). The actual evacuation was described by a doctor aboard the chartered Pan-Am aircraft as “the most incredible scene of deprivation and illness I’ve ever seen.” Children suffered from dehydration, pneumonia, diarrhea and viral disease, while staff members on the aircraft were running out of liquids to treat dehydration cases (Douglas Kneeland, New York Times, 7 April 1975). A year later, the Washington Post reported (25 April 1976) that only nine of over 2,000 “orphans” had been legally adopted, because it turned out that perhaps 2/3 are not orphans (Nation, 8 May 1976). In a San Francisco court, court-appointed experts testified that 18 of 25 randomly selected “babylift” children were illegally removed from Vietnam by private adoption agencies, many with parents who had signed no release. Sixty-nine are being given a fundamentalist Christian upbringing in a Baptist church where the pastor refuses repatriation to their parents because “Vietnam is communist now” (Liberation News Service, Guardian, New York, 26 November 1975). See also, Richard Flaste, New York Times (9 April 1975); Judith Coburn, “The War of the Babies,” Village Voice (14 April 1975); Gloria Emerson, “Operation Babylift,” New Republic, 26 April 1975. Among the more sordid scenes in this squalid affair was the sight of President Ford tearfully welcoming “orphans” and Hugh Hefner’s “Big Bunny” flying 40 orphans to the United States to be carried off the plane by Playboy bunnies (Washington Post, 10 April 1975).






[18](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt18). The Times refused to open its letters column to comments on this interesting gambit, though it published quite a wide range of responses to the editorial, including even a call for nuclear war. One letter that was not published, our own, read as follows:






An editorial in the Times, April 5, observes that “a decade of fierce polemics has failed to resolve this ongoing quarrel” between two contending views: that “the war to preserve a non-Communist, independent South Vietnam could have been waged differently,” and that “a viable, non-Communist South Vietnam was always a myth.” There has also been a third position: That apart from its prospects for success, the United States has neither the authority nor competence to intervene in the internal affairs of Vietnam. This was the position of much of the authentic peace movement, that is, those who opposed the war because it was wrong, not merely because it was unsuccessful. It is regrettable that this position is not even a contender in the debate, as the Times sees it.






On a facing page, Donald Kirk observes that “since the term ‘bloodbath’ first came into vogue in the Indochinese conflict, no one seems to have applied it to the war itself—only to the possible consequences of ending the war.” He is quite wrong. Many Americans involved in the authentic peace movement have insisted for years on the elementary point that he believes has been noticed by “no one,” and it is a commonplace in literature on the war. To mention just one example, we have written a small book on the subject (Counter-revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact and Propaganda, 1973), though in this case the corporation (Warner Brothers) that owned the publisher refused to permit distribution after publication. But quite apart from this, the observation has been made repeatedly in discussion and literature on the war, by just that segment of opinion that the Times editorial excludes from the debate.






[19](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt19). Among the most persuasive examples of the subservience of the press are those that it regards as its proudest moments; e.g., Watergate, a fact that is obvious enough if one looks just a bit below the surface. See Chomsky, introduction to Blackstock, ed., op. cit. (see chapter 1, footnote 34); Chomsky, “Nixon’s defenders do have a case,” More, December 1975.

Herman, Great Society Dictionary, Philadelphia, 1968: “A small fabricator of credibility; a wholly-owned subsidiary of the White House.” (See Volume I, chapter 4, section 1, for an example of Freedom House’s devotion to freedom.)






[22](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt22). Braestrup succeeds in portraying the media as unduly “pessimistic” by extensive fabrication of evidence and misrepresentation of his own documents, as is shown in detail in N. Chomsky, “The U.S. Media and the Tet Offensive,” Race and Class, XX, 1978; large parts appear in More, June 1978. See the same review for documentation on the subjects of this paragraph. Reviews and comment in the New York Times and Washington Post lauded this incompetent and hopelessly inaccurate work as “one of the major pieces of investigative reporting and first-rate scholarship of the past quarter century,” a “conscientious” and “painstakingly thorough study,” etc.






[23](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt23). Cf. Saburo Ienaga, The Pacific War, Pantheon, 1978, pp. 236f. Ienaga’s book is primarily a critique of Japanese fascism, aggression and atrocities. His documentation of crimes of the U.S. occupying army has yet to be mentioned in a review in the United States, to our knowledge. In the U.S. colony in the Philippines, meanwhile, the United States was engaged in dismantling the popular peasant-based anti-Japanese resistance and restoring to power the wealthy elites that collaborated successively with the U.S. occupiers, the Japanese, and then again the United States. In the course of these operations, U.S. military forces took part in a massacre of 109 peasant guerrillas who were rounded up, ordered to dig a mass grave, then shot “with the knowledge and consent of American [Counterintelligence Corps] officers present at the time.” The perpetrator of the massacre was then appointed mayor by the United States. Benedict J. Kerkvliet, The Huk Rebellion, University of California Press, 1977, p. 113, a valuable study of the origins of the Huk rebellion in peasant discontent intensified by U.S. colonialism, suppressed with the aid of U.S. military intelligence headed by Major Lansdale, later of Vietnam fame, regarded in the United States as a deep thinker with great insight into the peasant mind but in fact a typical colonialist fantasy-monger.

For details, see Stephen Salaff, “The Diary and the Cenotaph: Racial and Atomic Fever in the Canadian Record,” Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, April-June 1978. The racist sentence was concealed until the lapse of a 30-year prohibition on the publication of secret government papers. The example illustrates rather well what is often considered “a state secret.” On the racism of Western leaders during World War II, see Christopher Thorne, Allies of a Kind, Oxford, 1978. One wonders how Canadian (or Western) historians will deal with a comparable revelation concerning Prime Minister Lester Pearson, who is highly regarded in the West for his humanism. In released but unpublished sections of the Pentagon Papers it is revealed that Pearson was approached by the U.S. government in mid-1964 when the bombing of North Vietnam was under close consideration in the hope that the DRV might exert its influence to restrain the southern forces that were preventing the U.S. conquest of the South. The Nobel Peace Prize winner replied that nuclear weapons would be excessive, but conventional bombing would be quite legitimate.

It does not occur to her, apparently, that the treatment of German POWs in the United States was hardly a model of humanity as she describes it, even putting aside the fact that the U.S. pilots were shot down while destroying towns and villages in North Vietnam, which was not exactly parallel to the case of the German POWs in the United States.

The American revolutionary war, Fall wrote, “entirely fits the bill of the many revolutionary wars which afflict the middle of the twentieth century...it was a military operation fought by a very small armed minority—at almost no time did Washington’s forces exceed 8,000 men in a country which had at least 300,000 able-bodied males—and backed by a force of 31,897 French ground troops, and 12,660 sailors and Marines manning sixty-one major vessels.” Last Reflections on a War, p. 276.

Another standard reference is John Adams’s estimate that 1/3 of the population supported the revolution, 1/3 opposed it, and 1/3 were neutral (Shy, 166). Shy’s own analysis leads him to the conclusion that “almost certainly a majority of the population, [the great middle group of Americans] were the people who were dubious, afraid, uncertain, indecisive” and unwilling to risk the hazards and suffering of revolutionary struggle; “the prudent, politically apathetic majority of white American males was not eager to serve actively in the militia” (pp. 215, 217).






[47](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt47). “At first divided and vacillating, the bulk of the Indians were eventually driven by events to fight for their ‘ancient protector and friend’ the king of England” (Francis Jennings, “The Indians’ Revolution,” in Alfred F. Young, ed., The American Revolution: Explorations in the History of American Radicalism, Northern Illinois Univ. Press, 1976, p. 341). He explains why in vivid detail, concluding that “heedless of theories, Americans began the building of their empire with an inheritance of ethnocentric semantics that made logic valid to themselves out of the strange proposition that invasion, conquest, and dispossession of other peoples support the principle that all men are created equal” (p. 344).











The same curious logic, with regard to Blacks, was noted by Samuel Johnson, who asked: “How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?’’ Cited by Ira Berlin, “The revolution in black life,” in Young, ed., ibid., p. 356, an essay devoted to the Black response to the revolution.

[49](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt49). Benjamin Franklin, “after recounting the atrocities of the French and Indian wars,...called for the ‘extirpation’ of the French in Canada because of their manifold wickedness” (Shy, 238). Later, colonists raised an outcry against a 1774 act of the British Parliament concerning Quebec, stressing “the horrors of ‘Papacy,’ because it permitted Canada’s Catholics to worship without disturbance” (Jennings, op. cit., p. 339). “After the battles of Lexington and Concord,” Jennings continues, “the Second Constitutional Congress made an address to ‘the oppressed inhabitants of Canada,’ in which the Congress ‘perceived the fate of the protestant and catholic colonies to be strongly linked together’—so much for the popish menace—and appealed to the Canadians to overthrow the yoke of their ‘present form of tyranny.’ A few months later, the Congress’s armies invaded Quebec to confer the boon of liberty upon those poor, deserving Catholics” (340).






[50](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt50). Kamm is the reporter assigned by the New York Times to record the misery of those who escape from postwar Indochina. We return to his reporting below. Compare his rather different approach to refugees in Timor from U.S.-backed Indonesian terror. (Volume I, chapter 3, section 4.4).






[51](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt51). Though not as familiar as it should be, the treatment of Blacks and Indians after the war of independence is well enough known so that we need not recount it here. Recall that the first emancipation proclamation applying to American slaves was issued by the British in November, 1775, offering to free “all indentured servants, Negroes or others...able and willing to bear arms...” A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., In the Matter of Color, Oxford, 1978; excerpts in the Washington Post (21 May 1978). Slaveholders, in response, urged slaves to “be content with their situation, and expect a better condition in the next world.” Small wonder that thousands of Blacks joined the British forces, and “when the British left America at the end of the war, they carried thousands of blacks to freedom in Great Britain, the West Indies, Canada, and, eventually, Africa.” (Berlin, op. cit., pp. 353-55.)











An early draft of the American Declaration of Independence contained a condemnation of the slave trade, but this was deleted “in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia” (Jefferson). The British ridiculed the colonists for their protest against their alleged “enslavement” to England—their constant claim that “we are slaves” under British oppression (Josiah Quincy, and many others); see footnote 47. The rhetoric of the American revolutionaries was, however, used effectively by the abolitionists and others in later years. See Higginbotham, op. cit. Now a federal judge, Higginbotham was first impelled to study this subject, he writes, as a college student when his protest over the refusal to allow Black students to live in campus dormitories at Purdue University was met by the following response by President Edward Charles Elliott: “Higginbotham, the law doesn’t require us to let colored students in the dorm, and you either accept things as they are or leave the university immediately.’’ But in fairness we must add that this was, after all, only 160 years after liberation. Matters have since improved, as a result of the courageous struggles of Blacks in the 1950s and 1960s, but it is still possible for the state to murder Black leaders with impunity and imprison civil rights activists for long periods, with no public outcry and (in the latter case) no interest on the part of President Carter, whose concern for human rights looks selectively outward. See references of chapter 1, footnote 34 and Chomsky, ‘Human Rights’ and American Foreign Policy, pp. 69f.

The Laotians are largely Hmong Tribemen, organized by the CIA to fight against the Pathet Lao and then abandoned when they were no longer needed. (See chapter 1, section 1; and chapter 5.) By the end of the 1975-1978 period under review in this volume, the total number of refugees from Indochina remaining in Asia was estimated to be 333,500, including 150,000 refugees from Cambodia in Vietnam. Another 130,000 had been resettled in the United States, France, and elsewhere. These figures do not include the 135,000 airlifted from Vietnam by the United States in April 1975. Cited from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the Los Angeles Times, 8 January 1979. On the causes of the accelerated flight of refugees from Vietnam in mid and late 1978, see the preface to this volume.

[3](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt3). Among them are some 250,000 refugees from Zaire prior to the invasion of May, 1978, according to the UN High Commissioner for refugees, “mostly farmers who had arrived empty handed,” in some cases whole villages. “The Cold War in Africa,” Peace Press, London, July/August/September, 1978. The same report cites the observation of a Belgian refugee in the London Guardian (22 May 1978): “What the government troops did to the population down here after [the arrival of the Moroccan troops flown in by the French to expel the Katangese rebels in May 1978] was unbelievable. One whole village was massacred. Even the Moroccans...were disgusted.” President Mobutu of Zaire, maintained in power by French, Belgian and Moroccan forces backed by the United States, offered an amnesty to exiles from his rule. “Mobutu offers Amnesty to 200,000 Refugees,” Washington Post (25 June 1978). Upon their return, many thousands of these refugees were taken to detention centers, where they were subjected to interrogation and frequent beatings, all in “flagrant violations of the amnesty,” according to international officials on the scene.

In a rare reference to the flight of refugees from Burma, the Christian Science Monitor carried a Reuters dispatch from Bangladesh (16 November 1978) reporting that more than 5,000 of the Burmese Muslim refugees had been repatriated, though 190,000 “were still living in 13 improvised camps set up by the Bangladesh Government,” according to UN officials. In December 1978, one of the torrent of articles on refugees from Indochina then appearing mentioned the “bizarre tale of almost 200,000 Moslems who fled last May from Burma to Bangladesh ...” Richard M. Weintraub, “Asia’s Refugees: A New Wave of Human Migration,” Washington Post, 12 December 1978, the second of two long articles; most of the article was devoted to the refugees from Indochina, as was (in its entirety) the first article of the series the preceding day and a second article that also appeared on December 12. A third article on December 12 noted that at the UN meeting in Geneva devoted to “the Indochina refugee problem,” the U.S. government “called on governments around the world today to provide homes for the flood of Indochinese refugees.”






[6](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt6). See Volume I, chapter 4, section 1. In mid-July, China estimated the number of ethnic Chinese who fled Vietnam to China at 140,000. New York Times (15 July 1978). Later reports are higher; it seems that most ethnic Chinese were fleeing not to China but elsewhere in late 1978. Most of the increasing number of “boat people” in late 1978 are reported to be Chinese.

[8](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt8). Peter Weintraub, Far Eastern Economic Review, 16 December 1977. Compare the London Economist report of class backgrounds noted above. An analysis from Australia points out that there are many “doubts about identity” of refugees. A Catholic relief worker notes that “there have been white collar workers, public servants as well as army officers, who have said they were fishermen.” The Laotian and Cambodian refugees “come from a higher class, representing the ‘finest families imaginable,’” according to Berenice Lenze of the Indochinese Refugee Association. A large proportion of the refugees are Chinese—few of the Vietnamese who arrived even spoke Vietnamese. National Times (Australia), week ending 10 June 1978.






[9](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt9). Frederic A. Moritz, “The other refugees in Asia,” Christian Science Monitor, 30 March 1978. By “other” the Monitor means: “other than boat people”; not refugees from areas in Asia other than Indochina.






[10](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt10). See Jonathan C. Randal, Washington Post (20 March 1978). These are useful weapons against such targets as the Rashidiyeh Palestinian refugee camp, where “hours after the raid, an Israeli helicopter flew over the camp south of Tyre no more than 20 feet off the ground and was not fired upon” (Randal). The Israeli use of CBUs aroused some mild protest in the United States, presumably, on the grounds that only the United States has the right to use such weapons against defenseless people.






[11](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt11). H.D.S. Greenway, “Vietnam style raids gut South Lebanon,” Washington Post (25 March 1978). Interviewed in Israel about the attacks on the civilian population, Israeli Chief-of-Staff Mordechai Gur commented that these were nothing new: “For 30 years, from the War of Independence until today, we have been fighting against a population that lives in villages and cities.” Al-Hamishmar (10 May 1978).






[12](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt12). Maariv, 16 May 1978. This emigration is important for Israel because of the “demographic problem” posed by the presence of Arabs in a Jewish state, a very substantial minority given the intention since 1967 to maintain control of large parts of the West Bank and Gaza. Much of the “emigration” is far from voluntary.






[13](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt13). Jean-Pierre Clerc, Le Monde (3 November 1978); Pierre Simonitsch, Tages Anzeiger (Switzerland), 13 October 1978, citing official Costa Rican estimates that 10,000 refugees fled to Costa Rica in September joining 100,000 Nicaraguan refugees already in this country of two million people. The estimate for Honduras is about 8,000 refugees in September. Clerc writes that the refugees who fled to Costa Rica had to escape through barbed wire laid by Nicaraguan armed forces and that those in Honduras are suffering severe deprivation despite assistance from Austria.

[18](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt18). Jon Nordheimer, “Illegal Tide of Haitians Arriving on U.S. Shore,” New York Times (18 July 1978). The report was occasioned by the arrival of 33 “boat people” who were “rounded up by the police.” It claims that Haitian “boat people” are no longer imprisoned and that “confusion over the changing regulations, meanwhile, has slowed down the deportation of Haitians unable to show that they were political refugees from a country with friendly ties with the United States” (our emphasis), always the crucial consideration.

[20](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt20). 2,000 people attended a funeral in the Bahamas for 23 refugees who died at sea fleeing to Florida to avoid deportation to Haiti. Militant (1 September 1978), which also carries a report of a demonstration in Miami protesting “racist attacks” against Haitian refugees. The mainstream press rarely carries such news.






[21](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt21). The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service works in an interesting fashion. Its timing in the expulsion of victims of friendly tyrannies, for example, has a curious way of coinciding with union organizing. Thus in September, 1978, a group of Haitian custodians were arrested by INS just a day before contract negotiations for custodians were to begin. “The negotiations are now up in the air,” Martha Cooley reports; “I-Men Raid Quincy Market for Illegal Aliens, Impede Union Drives,” Real Paper, Cambridge (14 October 1978). This is one example of a pattern described in the article, mere coincidence according to INS.






[22](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt22). News conference, March 24, 1977; reprinted in the New York Times, March 25 without comment. Carter was asked by a CBS newsman whether the United States “has a moral obligation to help rebuild Vietnam.” At first he evaded the question. When it was reiterated he gave this response: we have no obligation because “the destruction was mutual.” Since “we went to Vietnam without any desire...to impose American will on other people” but only “to defend the freedom of the South Vietnamese,” there is no reason for us “to apologize or to castigate ourselves or to assume the status of culpability.” Nor do we “owe a debt.” One learns a good deal about the United States—indeed, the Free World—from the fact that such a statement made by the apostle of Human Rights can pass without notice.






[23](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt23). See Volume I, chapter 1, section 16.






[24](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt24). Christian Science Monitor (18 April 1978).






[25](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt25). The advisory board overturned the jury nominations in 5 of 10 cases. The others are also interesting. The prize for commentary went to William Safire, the extreme rightwing commentator of the New York Times, who was not even a finalist. The prize for editorial writing was awarded to Meg Greenfield of the Washington Post, who has specialized in urging a renewal of a harsher cold war stance, again overruling the jury recommendation. We have already discussed Kamm’s first published article after he received the Pulitzer Prize, namely, his report from Jakarta on Timor (Volume I, chapter 3, section 4.4).











4 Vietnam






[1](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt1). Recall the confident prediction of the editors of Dissent that all of those who fought the Communists would be slaughtered—i.e. many millions of people—tacitly reiterated again in the spring of 1975, but never specifically recalled since; see chapter 1 note 29. (See also Volume I, chapter 2, section 2.2.)






[2](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt2). Cited from Vietnam: If the Communists Won, Saigon, Vietnam Council on Foreign Relations, 1972, in The British Press and Vietnam, Indochina Information No. 3; written by a group of working journalists in the British media and published by the Indochina Solidarity Conference, 1973, the source of the background on this authority.






[3](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt3). New York Times (31 May 1978).






[4](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt4). Presumably, the source for the Tass dispatch is the Vietnam Press Agency, 26 January 1978, giving official statistics of 260,000 montagnards in the South of a total of 800,000 who have been resettled. Nayan Chanda, “Le communisme vietnamien en marche,” Le Monde diplomatique, April 1978. Chanda, regular Southeast Asia correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review, has been a perceptive commentator on affairs of the region for many years. His report of a visit to Vietnam in fact provides some basis for the claim made on purely a priori grounds in the New York Times. Certain montagnard areas, he writes, were closed to visits for security reasons, apparently because of montagnard discontent over the resettlement policy and the institution of Vietnamese as a common language for the whole country.






[5](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt5). Butterfield informed us that the wording in question was not his, but was added by “overly eager editing.” He apparently regards it as accurate, however, as we see directly.

II, section 2; Roger Hilsman, To Move A Nation, Delta, 1967, chapter 29, Milton Osborne, Strategic Hamlets in South Vietnam, Cornell University, 1965. Dean Rusk claimed that almost half the population had been relocated by 1963; cited in Chester Cooper, The Lost Crusade, Dodd, Mead, p. 201.

[11](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt11). But there have been protests, for example by the French anthropologist Georges Condominas, who worked with hill tribes that were virtually wiped out by U.S.-backed atrocities. (We Have Eaten the Forest, Allen Lane, 1977, introduction). In fact, the Vietnamese Communists seem to have a far better record than the various U.S.-imposed regimes in dealing with the hill tribes, and while many montagnards allied themselves with the United States (much as American Indians did with the British) because of fear of any Vietnamese, others fought with the Communists. For example, the capture of Ban Me Thuot, which began the final 1975 offensive, was reported by an escaped Catholic priest to have involved local montagnards but no North Vietnamese troops. Cf. Washington Post (15 March 1975), cited by Buttinger, Vietnam: the Unforgettable Tragedy, p. 150.






[12](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt12). See Chomsky, For Reasons of State, pp. 84f. for explicit recommendations on generating refugees, from the highest sources. See also pp. 5f. and elsewhere for relevant background.






[13](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt13). Butterfield states that the purposes of the resettlement program are “to relieve the major unemployment problem in parts of the south, to overcome chronic food shortages in the north by opening new farmland and to improve police control of the population by moving malcontent members of the bourgeoisie out of the cities.” He makes no reference to the “cost in human terms” of leaving millions of people to starve in the cities to which they were driven by U.S. programs of “forced-draft urbanization” and “modernization” (Harvard Professor Samuel Huntington’s euphemism for bombing the rural population into U.S.-controlled cities; cf. Chomsky, At War with Asia, pp. 54f.).






[14](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt14). Butterfield is, in fact, one of the more serious U.S. correspondents writing about Southeast Asia, and the New York Times, apart from its national stature, is perhaps on the liberal side of the narrow spectrum of the U.S. media. In the admittedly rather silly Freedom House study of the press discussed above, p. 34, the Times is described as an “antiwar journal.” See Volume I, chapter 2, note 101, for the consequences of its allegedly “leftist” positions, as perceived by U.S. business interests.






[15](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt15). Butterfield writes that “many highly trained and educated southerners, between 50,000 and 100,000, analysts estimate, remain imprisoned in so-called re-education camps.”






[16](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt16). Compare, in contrast, the behavior of the U.S. and Britain in detaining hundreds of thousands of German POWs in “reeducation camps” where they could be used for forced labor for up to three years after World War II, or the execution of hundreds of Japanese and massive purges in Japan and Germany, regarded as proof of Western humanitarianism. (See above, chapter 2, section 2.)






[17](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt17). See, among many other examples, Fox Butterfield, “Shortages, Misrule and Corruption Said to Plague Vietnam’s Economy,” New York Times (9 June 1978), (reporting, inter alia, a 10 to 12% rise in industrial production in each of the past two years; but this was “from a very low base, largely reflecting recovery from war damage rather than new growth,” analysts in Hong Kong believe); Peter Hazelhurst, “Old-style corruption begins to taint new regime in Saigon,” London Times (24 April 1978), describing how the daughter of “a wealthy Chinese jeweller” was able to purchase travel documents to escape through bribery, and the problems that face the formerly wealthy as the black market is suppressed.






[18](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt18). The United States is unlikely to attend to these lessons, for obvious reasons, but people who live in its neo-colonial domains may come to heed them, realizing the longstanding fears of U.S. planners with regard to the “ideological successes” of Communist regimes, the rational version of the “domino theory.” See chapter 1, section 2, and the references cited there. It is interesting to compare the situation in the Caribbean. See, for example, Mike Phillips, “Cuba’s shifting image lends a new model to the Caribbean,” New Statesman, 18 April 1978. While in the West, Phillips comments, “Cuba is most often seen as a tool of Soviet policy and, as such, fatally discredited within its own sphere of influence,” in fact, “the reverse is very nearly true” and there is “a renewed pro-Fidel groundswell among Latin American nationalists,” not because of Castroite propaganda but rather because the effect of U.S. policies in Latin America is all too obvious to their victims while “Cuba now offers the Caribbean the choice between attempting to transform its own economies and continuing to accept the model of dependency,” with its “torture, poverty, the suppression of human rights, financial bankruptcy or the overall dependence (in most of the smaller countries) on the whims and necessities of foreign capital.” One can see the logic in the intensive but failed efforts of the United States to subvert Cuban social and economic development by poisoning food supplies, trying to assassinate Castro, terrorist attacks, etc. (See Volume I, chapter 2, note 94.)






[19](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt19). New York Times (9 April 1978). The situation seems still worse in other nearby U.S. colonies, where Filipino workers have been murdered “under mysterious circumstances.” Few of the Filipino and Korean workers have been willing to report abuses for fear of deportation, since even under these conditions (“like slavery”) they “can usually make more in an hour than they could for a full day’s work, say, in Manila,” where workers benefit from the fruits of a U.S. humanitarian effort that began 80 years ago. Cf. Volume I, chapter 4, section 3. An ACLU observer on Guam states that immigration officers and the code they apply have given contractors and their agents “virtually total power over their workers, a licence to steal and beat the men without restraint,” while female immigrants, according to the labor department official cited, “have been forced to have sexual relations with immigration officers to keep from being deported.”











This report, a rare example of serious journalism, aroused no comment and quickly passed from memory.

[22](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt22). See also Patrice de Beer, Le Monde (26-28 January 1976), translated in the Manchester Guardian Weekly (11 July 1976): “It is realized in Saigon today that Operation Phoenix, conducted by the Americans, which involved the elimination of Communist Party officials, together with the bombings had been fearfully effective. The number of revolutionary cadres is said to have dropped from the 80,000 or so before the United States intervened to a maximum of 50,000 in 1975, most of them soldiers. Party cells were successively wiped out in the rural districts and decimated in the cities. At the beginning of the new regime, there were 5,000 militants in Saigon, of whom 2,000 were cadres, not necessarily the best, but those who had managed to survive Nguyen Van Thieu’s repression machine. ‘In the last few years of the war,’ Nguyen Huu Tho, the president of the Front, told me, ‘our activities declined because our comrades had been eliminated...The best of us were sacrificed, and we did not have enough cadres to run the cities after the liberation. We had to take people who had revolutionary fervour, but no experience, and to bring personnel down from the North.’” (See chapter 1, section 2, and Volume I, chapter 5, section 1.5.)






[23](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt23). “Vietnam Communists Inter Once-Vital ‘Front’ Group,” Washington Post (5 February 1977), reprinted from the Manchester Guardian. Woollacott is unusual in that he recognized that “the Front was an enormous human achievement and a formidable instrument of war.”






[24](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt24). Long An happens to be a particularly well-studied province because of the outstanding work of Jeffrey Race, who described Communist success there prior to the U.S. invasion of 1965. See further, Volume I, chapter 5.

[27](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt27). Cf. Martin Woollacott, “Vietnam: still two nations,’’ Manchester Guardian Weekly (25 April 1976). He writes that “South Vietnam now has, for the first time, something like a true health service.” He cites a Catholic sister who had worked in the Central Highlands for 20 years and “described with admiration how within weeks of taking over, the Communists had established clinics in every village and new 50-bed hospitals in the towns. People who previously had no chance of hospital treatment at all were now getting it.” See note 97. See also the report of the study mission to Vietnam by Senator Edward Kennedy for comment on achievements of the health program and the enormous problems caused by lack of supplies and the legacy of the war. Congressional Record, S 14007f., 22 August 1978. Also, Hearing before the Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Ninety-Fifth Congress, second session, 22 August 1978, in which members of the study mission testified, reporting determined and in some cases encouraging efforts to meet health and nutrition problems despite deplorable conditions. Mildred Kaufman summarized what appears to be their general impression: “I was very impressed with the rather stark conditions under which the people of Vietnam are valiantly struggling to overcome the aftermath of the war” (p. 25).











Health care developments under the extremely onerous conditions of Indochina are especially interesting for the contrast with conditions under subfascism. We have discussed in Volume I the absolute decline of public health expenditures under the auspices of the Brazilian generals, and the similar disregard for the health conditions of the majority in the Philippines, Indonesia and elsewhere in the subfascist empire. We are awaiting a Butterfield-Kamm study comparing medical care in the countryside of Indochina with that in, say, Indonesia or South Vietnam under U.S. rule, taking into account both the facts and the resources available.

[30](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt30). Time the same day quotes Secretary of Defense Harold Brown who explains that “a lesson we learned in Vietnam is that we should be very cautious about intervening in any place where there is a poor political base for our presence.” Time (23 May 1977). If there is a good political base, as the Russians claim to have found in Czechoslovakia in 1968, then the use of massive U.S. force to destroy “local Communist subversion or rebellion that does not constitute armed attack” in violation of the supreme law of the land is, presumably, quite appropriate. (Cf. chapter1, note 16).

[32](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt32). Butterfield follows standard Western practice in identifying southerners who hold key decision-making positions in the Hanoi regime as “northerners.” That Vietnamese adhere to these imperialist conventions is perhaps open to question.






[33](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt33). See the reports of Snepp, Casella, de Beer, and Dudman cited above. “One possible factor behind the continued dominance of Northerners in the reunified Vietnam,” Butterfield speculates, “is that the old ethnic prejudices between Northerners and Southerners have persisted.” Another possible factor is that the United States decimated what it always recognized to be the only mass-based political force in the South, but this factor is not fit to print.






[34](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt34). See also the AFP report carried by the New York Times (16 March 1978) on a road trip from Hanoi to Saigon which reveals “a startling new look to this country a little less than three years after the end of hostilities”—new construction, rice fields and coffee plantations, and homes that “have sprung up in areas that two years ago still resembled lunar landscapes,” in areas that were “like a desert because of the bombing.” The report continues: “Provincial authorities in the south reported large surpluses of rice but did not explain why the surplus had not been sent north.” No speculation on the reasons is offered.






[35](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt35). A personal experience may be relevant. After a few days in Vientiane, one of us (Chomsky) was brought into contact with underground Pathet Lao cadres and sympathizers in the city, including a teacher in a Buddhist school (who was, shortly after, picked up by CIA agents), a guerrilla from northern Laos, and a minister in the U.S.-backed government who was hoping for a Pathet Lao victory. Cf. At War With Asia, chapter 4, where identities were concealed in the midst of the ongoing U.S. war. The attitudes of such people could barely have been known to readers of the Free Press, which also virtually ignored the hundreds of thousands of rural and urban poor, who are rarely considered when assessments of attitudes are given by Butterfield and others.






[36](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt36). As contrasted with the hordes of Vietnamese correspondents freely roaming about the United States, which was never invaded and demolished by Vietnam. Even a Vietnamese nun visiting Canada was apparently denied entry into the United States. See Don Luce’s Congressional testimony in the Hearings to which we return (see note 70).






[37](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt37). New York Times (20 September 1977). This ridiculous pretense was abandoned by the Times shortly after, with the publication of reports by Ian Mather (reprinted from the London Observer), October 13, 14, 18, 27, 1977; and Horst Faas, October 13, 16, November 13, 1977. As we will see in chapter 6, Kamm adopts a similar pretense in the case of Cambodia. In the case of East Timor, however, Indonesian officials are the principal source of information for the Times correspondent. See Volume I, chapter 3, section 4.4.

[40](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt40). Ibid. pp. 182, 194. It should be added that Vietnam was “irremediably miserable” not because of God’s wrath, but as a direct result of the vicious practices of French colonialists, documented in painstaking detail by Ngo Vinh Long, Peasant Revolutionary Struggles in Vietnam in the 1930s, Harvard University Ph.D. Dissertation, May, 1978; see also his Before the Revolution: the Vietnamese Peasants Under the French, MIT Press, 1973, which includes a revealing account of these years as seen by peasants themselves. The revolutionary struggles of the 1930s, as Long fully documents, were part of an impressive struggle for independence and democratic control of social life, intensified by the miserable conditions resulting from French rule which led to mass deaths from starvation in the 1930s, while the French (working in part through their local allies among landlords and village officials) compelled the starving peasants to purchase alcohol from their monopoly, withheld aid, prevented the rebuilding of dikes and wantonly murdered those who stood in their way. Now, Western reporters bewail the fact that Indochinese revolutionaries who studied in Paris failed to absorb the traditional “humanism” of Western civilization. See Martin Woollacott, Boston Globe (2 October 1977) excerpted from the Manchester Guardian.

[43](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt43). Like drug addiction, venereal disease was virtually unknown prior to the U.S. invasion. See Don Luce’s congressional testimony to which we return. We may note, in this connection, some recent concern in the United States over the fact that many war veterans appear to be developing symptoms associated with excessive use of defoliants. See, for example, Boston Globe (25 March, 8 October 1978); New York Daily News (11 June 1978). Notably missing from these reports is any concern for the possible effects on the Vietnamese, who were surely subject to far heavier doses, or for U.S. responsibility to offer them some medical assistance. On this matter see the comments by Arthur Galston, a plant physiologist at Yale University, in the private hearings cited in note 56. In the Far Eastern Economic Review, 11 August 1978, Tom Grundfeld reports Galston’s conclusions on his return from the most recent of his many trips to Vietnam. Apart from the ecological damage caused by bombing and chemical warfare, what particularly concerned him was the extensive use of herbicides containing dioxin, which causes cancer. “Galston said that liver cancer is now the second most common cause of death in Vietnam, where before the war it was rare.”






[44](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt44). Recall again the interesting list of the sole violators of human rights that deserve such punishment by the U.S. guardians of global morality: Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Cuba, Mozambique, Angola—and Uganda, thrown in for good measure, and something of a joke, since the United States is “Uganda’s largest free world trading partner, buying one third of its coffee exports in 1977 (price tag: $245 million) and thereby providing the hard currency essential to keeping Amin’s repressive regime in power.” Senator Lowell Weicker, “Stop subsidizing Amin’s murders,” Christian Science Monitor (21 August 1978). Coffee sales amount to over 85% of the government’s revenues, according to Weicker. Among the other current contributors to Idi Amin are “a mysterious Israeli tycoon and the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence service,” who “appear to have provided Idi Amin’s Uganda Airlines with its two Boeing 707 jetliners as part of an Israeli effort to spy on Libya,” an absurdity, since it is well known to the Libyans so that “nobody is fooling anybody in this affair,” though “Idi Amin must be delighted with a cut-rate service that transports Ugandan coffee, officials and their mistresses to Europe and brings back whiskey, machine tools, livestock, and Mercedes Benz limousines.” “But the big winner in this operation appears to be Shaul Eisenberg, the elusive Israeli entrepreneur at its center.” Eisenberg works in close collaboration with the Israeli Aircraft Industry, a subsidiary of the Israeli Defense Department; his trading firm is also supported by “the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which is supposed to make loans to promote American exports.” He is also “the sole beneficiary of what in Israel is called ‘the Eisenberg law’ [which] exempts from tax certain companies that do business abroad. So far, it fits only Eisenberg.” “Ugandan Plane Deal Believed Key to Israeli Spy Operation,” Washington Post, London (11 September 1978). Presumably the author is Bernard Nossiter; see his “How the CIA keeps Idi Amin in whiskey,” New Statesman, (13 October 1978), virtually the same article, but with the additional information on CIA involvement, or perhaps coordination.

[47](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt47). The cynical exploitation of the MIA issue by the United States merits little comment. Reporting on Carter’s Commission to Hanoi to inquire into the MIA matter, the Washington Post sermonized that “it is ghoulish for the Vietnamese to trade on heartbreak,” but we must understand that “‘the losses they themselves suffered—losses that they define as an American responsibility—left them with little else to trade” (how odd that they should define these losses as “an American responsibility”). But they can expect no more than “token direct assistance from Washington,” given their human rights record, the Post explains. (“Vietnam Mission,” Washington Post, 23 March 1971). Nayan Chanda (“Laying the MIA issue to rest,” Far Eastern Economic Review, 11 March 1977) reports the same story in a slightly different way. The report of the U.S. Select Committee on the Missing Persons in Southeast Asia, he writes, “clearly shows how Hanoi has been pressed to supply information about people lost in non-hostile circumstances, on the open sea and unknown to the Vietnamese authorities.” The existence of such cases “erodes the credibility of the United States’ data base...it may appear to the Indochinese leaders that the United States has deliberately requested information which they cannot furnish in order to embarrass them or to prevent meaningful talks” (quoted from the Committee reports).

A Catholic and cousin of the Archbishop of Saigon, he was editor of Tin Sang until it was banned by Thieu and then escaped to Europe. He is now once again editing Tin Sang. Ho Ngoc Nhuan was a member of the Saigon Assembly. Ly Chanh Trung is a well-known Catholic intellectual.

He prints articles critical of the government and publishes translations of foreign affairs analyses from Le Monde of Paris, the New York Times and the Washington Post. The Thieu regime cut off his newsprint, confiscated his property and sentenced him to prison for doing that sort of thing.” He claims that there is no censorship, but adds: “I am a self-censor—I know what we should publish in the interests of the country and the Vietnamese people.” Such self-censorship can be equivalent to censorship, or worse (if accompanied by the delusion of freedom), as readers of the Free Press should be aware.

[67](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt67). Catholic missionaries have long been notorious for their role in colonial oppression. For example, during the peasant uprisings in 1930-1931 French priests led “pacification” teams. Others usurped communal land and brought soldiers to intimidate and kill resisting peasants. The heavily censored Saigon press in 1938 reported that the manager of an estate of a French Catholic priest closed canals that were the communication routes for peasants in the area and forced them to pay tolls or hand over possessions, resorting to savage beatings if they refused, with no action by the French authorities despite much publicity. Long, Peasant Revolutionary Struggle (pp. 50, 212, 225).











The dubious role of the Catholic Church during the war has been discussed in the National Catholic Reporter, a leading church weekly, after a year-long investigation of the Catholic Relief Services by its Washington correspondent, Richard Rashke. Rashke alleges that “during much of the Vietnam War, Catholic Relief Services abandoned its apolitical humanitarian role and became an adjunct of the American military effort,” turning over “vast quantities of relief supplies...to both U.S. and South Vietnamese military units to be used as pay for irregular forces and incentives for intelligence gathering” and allowing U.S. military personnel to work in relief offices where they had access to “information valuable to military intelligence but possible disastrous to the Vietnamese civilians whom the organization was chartered to help.” The report charges that 90% of the church relief agency’s budget came from the US AID program “on a quid pro quo basis, which presupposed the church agency would reciprocate ‘by accepting U.S. policy without criticism and by sharing information with US AID personnel.’” US AID was admittedly a CIA cover in Laos from 1962, and perhaps elsewhere as well. Catholic Relief Services also supplied rations for interrogation centers and political prisons, including the Con Son prison with its “tiger cages.” It was incorporated into the U.S. refugee program which forced “Vietnamese civilians from homes and farms into refugee camps, which were supplied by the organization.” After earlier criticisms in this regard, the organization “merely changed the accounting procedures,” Rashke alleges. Quotes from Marjorie Hyer, Washington Post (13 December 1976). See also Kenneth A. Briggs, New York Times (14 December 1976).











Western visitors to Indochina (including one of us) have observed the cruel and inhuman attitude of some Catholic missionaries towards the population, which has a long history. It is remarkable that the testimony of Catholic missionaries condemning alleged practices of Indochinese revolutionaries is so commonly accepted without question in the West.











On the role of missionaries in Vietnam and elsewhere, see the interview with Doug Hostetter, “An Insider’s Story: Religious Agencies in Viet-Nam,” in NACLA’s Latin America and Empire Report, December 1973: Christian Mission for the Empire; Rev. Richard Edwards, “The CIA and Christian Mission: Can We Get the CIA Out of the Church,” Signs of the Times, Winter, 1978. Both articles review evidence of what Hostetter calls the “nice hand-in-glove relationship between the Christian clergy and the U.S. military” and the CIA. Cf. also Volume I, chapter 3, section 4.3.






[68](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt68). The Catholic Church seems to be taking the same stand. At the Synod of Bishops in Rome, October, 1977, the Archbishop of Saigon who attended and then travelled in Europe along with Cardinal Trin Nhu-Kue of Hanoi, discussed the problems faced by the church in operating in a “marxist milieu”: “Instead of theoretical discussions, the communists want only concrete facts. The christians therefore have to show a new countenance, the authentic countenance of Christ and the Church.” Accordingly, “In July, 1976 at the Episcopal Conference of the two ecclesiastical provinces of Hue and Saigon we bishops unanimously and without ambiguity launched an appeal to all the Catholics, inviting them to take the way of commitment, i.e., contribute to the construction of society.” The Pope, in response, urged Catholic relief organizations to offer assistance to Vietnam and encouraged Catholics in Vietnam to take part with all their strength in “the great work of reconstruction” (L’Osservatore Romano, 9 December 1977); distributed along with the statement of the Archbishop by Fraternité Vietnam—see note 51, this chapter).











See Henry Tanner, “Saigon Archbishop Says Coexistence with Reds is Vital,” New York Times (10 October 1977). On the “reconciliation between the anti-communist Roman Catholic Church of the south and the unified communist government,” see Nayan Chanda, “Clergy and comrades link arms,” Far Eastern Economic Review, 8 October 1976. Chanda discusses the goodwill shown by the government towards the church after the dismantling of a counterrevolutionary group discovered with arms and equipment for counterfeiting currency in a southern church; see Chanda, Far Eastern Economic Review, 27 February 1976 and Turley (see note 72, this chapter). Chanda also cites a letter from the Saigon Archbishop to a Paris Catholic newspaper in which he explains the cooperation of the church with the Communists on grounds that religious freedom “has really been respected” including liturgical ceremonies and conversions to Catholicism.

A few of the many hints that the press might have followed up had it chosen to do so, apart from those already cited: Bill and Peggy Herod, “Vietnam Observations from Hong Kong,” The Disciple, 17 April 1977; H. Lamar Gibble of the Board of World Ministry, “Report on consultations with religious leaders in Vietnam,” 4-11 May 1977; Rev. George W. Webber, Chairperson of Clergy and Laity Concerned, letter, Washington Post, 12 January 1977; representatives of the AFSC and church groups who lived in or visited Vietnam after liberation, who testified in Congressional Hearings: Hearings before the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives, Ninety-Fifth Congress, First Session, June 16, 21 and July 26, 1977 (among them Don Luce, who had lived and worked in Vietnam for many years as head of International Voluntary Services and as a journalist, is fluent in Vietnamese, and met privately with “at least 50 former friends,” generally Third Force people, including friends who had returned from reeducation centers); and many others.






[71](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt71). The group is small for many reasons, one of them being the inability of many young scholars who depart from mainstream ideology to obtain employment, a matter that amply merits a careful study; there are many examples that illustrate a minor academic purge.

[73](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt73). The term “ironic” seems out of place, in the light of the systematic policies of the United States throughout its far-flung subfascist domains.






[74](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt74). We have found no record of this. As far as we can determine, Hoan was a minor member of a neutralist Buddhist group. Don Luce, who was well-acquainted with Third Force leaders, testified in the Hearings that he did not know Hoan “as an outspoken antigovernment figure there.” Whatever his role may have been, he never achieved the prominence of such non-Communist dissidents as Ngo Ba Thanh, Ngo Cong Duc, Ly Chanh Trung, Father Chan Tin, Huynh Tan Mam, or others now reported to be active in southern Vietnam, whose reports are ignored.






[75](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt75). In his testimony before the same committee, Nguyen Van Coi of the militantly anti-Communist Hoa Hao Buddhist sect estimates the number of prisoners at one million. Actually his testimony is in some respects more convincing than that of Hoan, since he recounts numerous personal incidents of torture and abuse during almost a year in detention centers and forced labor camps before his escape in October 1976, whereas Hoan offers almost no direct testimony.











The official government position is that there are about 50,000 people imprisoned “for security reasons.” International Herald Tribune, 5 February 1977. Reports on the character of “reeducation camps” vary widely. Compare the testimony of Coi with the observations of McCleary and Meinertz in the Congressional Hearings (see note 70, this chapter), and the subsequent remarks of Luce (115) on conversations with people released from camps. (See also Chanda, p. 68, and similar reporting in Lacouture, op. cit. and elsewhere.) In the private hearings cited above (note 56), Luce quotes the report of one American, Jay Scarborough, who spent five months in a camp and described the treatment as humane. Actually, there is no direct inconsistency among these radically conflicting reports; it is possible that the camps vary widely in character.











The Lacoutures conclude that the camps “are evidently not Gulag—not l’école des Roches [a finishing school] either.” Richard Dudman, who describes a visit to one camp, reports the view of several Western diplomats in Hanoi that the reeducation program seems “to have been an effective trade-off that avoided any possibility of the bloodbath” that had long been predicted after a bitter civil struggle. “Several individual non-Communist Vietnamese who could be questioned privately said that they had been amazed at the leniency of the victorious Communists.” St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “Vietnam’s Dismal New Camps,” (3 November 1977). See also, Casella, op. cit.






[76](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt76). This was offered in response to a question by Rep. Smeeton about the “50,000 to 500,000 people...killed during the ‘refashioning’ of the North’s agriculture and economy” in the 1950s. In an earlier session, Turley had testified on these exaggerated propaganda claims, offering the estimate of probably 5,000 killed on the basis of Moise’s careful study. Cf. Volume I, chapter 5, section 2.2. As is so often true, mere fact is never allowed to get in the way of useful propaganda concerning the enemy.






[77](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt77). In Africa, the Middle East, and Taiwan, Hoan said, referring to unidentified press reports.






[78](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt78). See the eyewitness reports of Ediger, Klassen, Tran and many others. In the same Congressional Hearings Don Luce reported that he had seen religious materials published in South Vietnam and had attended churches in Hanoi and Saigon that were functioning with parishioners. He also recalled that the Archbishop of Hanoi was recently made a Cardinal by the Vatican, and stated that the former teachers continue to teach in Catholic Schools. Paul F. Mcleary, Executive Director of the World Church Service Delegation, testified that he “went unexpectedly to a 6 a.m. mass at a Roman Catholic Church. It was filled.” The Archbishop said that “there were over 100 studying in a major seminary to go into the priesthood, that they were not decreasing in terms of the size of the church, but he felt they were now growing....At this point, the leadership of the Buddhist community, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Protestant Church...seem supportive of the present political situation, the present government, and did not give indications that these kinds of pressures existed upon them, or that there were restraints on their activities.” In the 22 August 1978 Hearings (see note 27, this chapter) Archbishop Philip M. Hannan described his attendance at a crowded mass. (See notes, 52, 68, 70, 83, this chapter.)

[83](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt83). Several examples have been mentioned and we return to others. One further well-known example is Richard Hughes, who continued his work with orphans while living with the Vietnamese until he left in August, 1976. Even during the war, American visitors to Vietnam were free to speak privately to Vietnamese whom they met through professional and other contacts and the absence of overt security was remarkable under the circumstances, as we know from direct experience and the testimony of friends. For example, one of us (Chomsky) spent many hours with professional colleagues in Hanoi and walked unaccompanied through both urban and remote village areas. Hoan’s claim requires us to believe that policies have radically changed in the postwar period, despite substantial testimony to the contrary. We have heard privately from reputable journalists who have visited Vietnam that friends from earlier years seemed afraid to talk to them, but that is considerably short of Hoan’s blanket claim. Others do not report anything of the sort. For example, John Fraser of the Toronto Globe and Mail reports that he spent two weeks “in and around Ho Chi Minh city,” left to his own devices insofar as he chose. He “covered nearly all the districts of the city, by day and night, and talked to a great number of people.” He found “the willingness of so many people to talk openly about their frustrations and complaints...exhilarating—a journalist’s gold mine,” though ultimately this openness was “oppressive” since he “had no help or remedies to offer” to their discontents. His testimony too is radically inconsistent with Hoan’s claims.











As for the “discontent” so openly voiced in Saigon, Fraser found that “the complaints were rarely what we in the West would describe as human rights problems” but rather “huge gripes about the declining standard of living,” that is, the decline in the “subsidized and materialistic standard of living [that] had been provided for this city” (or at least those elements of the city with whom journalists were familiar). Like other commentators concerned with fact, he too points out that the Communists have gone out of their way to maintain the artificial economy of Saigon, despite the grinding poverty elsewhere: “For all the talk of revenge, people in Saigon eat better, dress better, work less and have more trinkets to play with than the people of Hanoi, whose poverty remains real and painfully obvious.” Fraser was particularly struck by the Saigon “cowboys,” “some of the toughest young people I have ever encountered,” the gangster element created by the U.S. invaders who now refuse to work and constitute a continuing social problem. Fraser found the new Saigon/Ho Chi Minh city to be neither at the extreme of “a city groaning under oppression” nor a city with “a new dignity,” though it had “aspects of both.” Reprinted in the Christian Science Monitor (5 December 1978), from the Toronto Globe and Mail (25 November 1978). This is part 2 of a seven-part series (24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 November and 1 December). In other sections, he describes the horrendous problems facing this “blighted land” of “grinding poverty” in the North and a “declining standard of living” for those in the South who have to “come to terms with the reality of Vietnam’s over-all poverty.” The problems include the legacy of the war, open warfare along the Cambodian border and a dangerous confrontation with China, catastrophic flooding and “the prospect of famine,” and “an almost complete lack of foreign funds to pay for its modest plans in modernization.” The ethnic Chinese, he believes, are not persecuted in the North, “while in the South, the actual persecution of ethnic Chinese is based exclusively on class and economic divisions.” But the problem was handled quite clumsily, he believes. In contrast, “the Catholic question is being managed with considerable sophistication and finesse” in the South, and he gives a interesting account of Church-State accommodation and conflict. He also relates conversations with Mme. Ngo Ba Thanh and Father Huynh Cong Minh, “also a member of the National Assembly as well as the editor of a national Catholic newspaper,” both non-Communists who struck him “as deeply troubled and sincere people struggling to come to terms with present-day reality in Vietnam,” basically supportive of the regime and its policies.

Bishop Thuan is in fact held under police custody in Hanoi, according to a letter from Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) that was “slipped out” to the Vatican “under the noses of Communist officials.” Thuan is a nephew of former President Diem and “an outspoken anti-Communist.” Archbishop Binh wrote that he had met with Thuan just before his trip to Rome (see note 68). He wrote that Thuan is “in good health, although a little thinner, and alert in his mind” and quoted him as saying that he was well-treated: “I am quite well today, so please, when you go to Rome, explain to the Pope and to the archbishop who is in charge of preaching and to others what is the truth in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. I say these things, not because of the presence of this cadre in Hanoi but because it is the truth.” Richard Dudman, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (7 November 1977).

Another person alleged by Jacqueney to be a prisoner is Tran Ngoc Chau, who was arrested by the Thieu regime and imprisoned in 1969. Chau had been Program Director of Revolutionary Development, a pacification program designed to gather intelligence on the NLF infrastructure, and in his trial claimed to be a supporter of Thieu and Nixon (see Indochina Resource Center report, cited above). Jacqueney does not report the fact that Chau was framed with the collaboration of William Colby, CIA Station Chief Theodore Shackley and Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, and that the CIA in Washington refused to evacuate him from Vietnam (Snepp, op. cit., p. 15; recall Casella’s observation, p. 84 above). Richard Dudman reported from Vietnam that “A well-informed Vietnamese said that Chau had been under house arrest until early October but now was free” (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 3 November 1977).






[93](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt93). The reason cannot have been that U.S. journals do not review French books or that Lacouture is unknown. For example, Father François Ponchaud’s highly critical account of postwar Cambodia became an instant media hit when it was reviewed in the New York Review by Jean Lacouture, with considerable embellishment, only a few weeks after its publication in Paris. We return to this book and its reception in the West in chapter 6.






[94](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt94). According to the New York Review, he arrived in Vietnam “in December 1948 and stayed on for twenty-eight years.” He himself says that he arrived in Vietnam in 1957 and “starting in 1963, and for 13 years without interruption, I was on the staff of the Alexander-de-Rhodes Student Center...(Congressional Hearings, June-July, 1977, p. 81). Later he claims to “have lived with the people for 19 years” (p. 22). The Globe and Mail introduces him as having spent 19 years in Vietnam. The issue is not particularly important in itself, but gains some interest in the context of the more general question of the credibility of Gelinas’s report and the media treatment of it.











According to a detailed curriculum vitae provided by Father Tran Tam Tinh of Fraternité Vietnam in a letter of 15 March 1977, Gelinas spent the years 1958-59 and 1965-76 in Saigon. In 1957 and 1964 he was in Taiwan and from 1960-63 at Columbia University in New York. Basically the same account appears in Seven Days, 9 May 1977 in an article by Jon Steinberg.

[97](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt97). To our knowledge, no visitor or resident in Vietnam apart from Gelinas has reported mass suicides in September-October, 1975 following the currency regulations. Ms. Forsythe, however, has some other things to say based on her three years in South Vietnam, including 6 months after the war when “I was free to travel anywhere in the city, and did so...by public bus or on foot...[which]...gave me ample chance to meet ordinary people and observe the impact of the new government on the daily lives of people.” She reports having seen children suffering from severe malnutrition under the U.S.-Thieu regime, eating only leaves, apparently because the Saigon armed forces were hoarding rice purchased by the United States for distribution to the needy, and children killed or wounded by ARVN soldiers for revenge or “target practice.” She also describes the many false rumors that circulated during and after the war about Viet Cong atrocities, discussions with neighbors who returned to ordinary lives after “study and practice” (i.e., “reeducation”), the impressive spirit of students who were engaged in social and economic reconstruction, and the substantial improvement in health care for the poor people who “are benefactors of any aid that is flowing into that country” which, for the first time, has honest officials. She denies most of what Gelinas reports, saying “It is very hard for me in listening to Father Gelinas to square what he says with my own experience,” the standard reaction, as we shall see. Her report, as distinct from that of Gelinas, did not exactly become an international media sensation.

[103](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt103). Compare the report by Father Gianni (cf. note 69), who left Vietnam at the same time as Gelinas. “I remember the day on which many of us were invited to a meeting with the civil authorities. They thanked all of us foreign religious for the many years missionaries from abroad had been working in Vietnam. But since they claimed that the number of native Vietnamese priests, sisters and religious was sufficient, we were no longer needed, and so they invited us to return to our own native countries...Here, as in many other cases, when the socialist government of Vietnam invited foreign missionaries to leave, this brought into focus a situation in need of correction for many years in Vietnam.”

[105](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt105). Don Braid, “Viets ‘pray for war,’” Montreal Star (26 March 1977). Excerpts of the L’Express-New York Review interview are reprinted, and the journal notes that this “highly unflattering report...has appeared in mass-circulation newspapers and magazines in France, Italy, England and the United States.” Here Gelinas is said to have “lived in Vietnam for 15 years” (see note 94), and he has become the “director of the Alexander of Rhodes Education Center.”






[106](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt106). Martin, who remained in Vietnam after the war ended, is the author of Reaching the Other Side; cf. note 10, this chapter. Many of the same charges by Gelinas are refuted, on the basis of direct eyewitness observation, by Forsythe, Hughes, and the Canadian Vietnamese visitors; for example, his claims about a “coup d’état against the PRG” on July 19-20, 1975, when “the city woke up in a state of siege,” and the PRG headquarters “was surrounded by armored cars” (he expands on this “coup” in his congressional testimony). During this “coup,” Martin reports, “friends and I rode bicycles freely around town” observing nothing except somewhat enhanced security arrangements in expectation of demonstrations and violence that did not eventuate; he also points out that Gelinas mislocated the PRG headquarters. Forsythe also reports that while there was street gossip about a possible “coup,” it “never took place” and “there was no unrest” and “never a purging of the PRG from any level in Saigon” to her knowledge. Hughes adds that not only was there no “coup d’état against the PRG,” but in fact any such coup “would have resoundingly failed because, among other things,” the place mentioned by Gelinas is “not where their ‘headquarters’ was” (they actually had no headquarters, he adds, but rather leadership was “decentralized into a plethora of almost autonomous ‘offices’ (themselves broken down into smaller teams), functions, and locations.” Hughes also comments on the absurdity of the belief that tanks and infantry could have rounded up “a widely scattered, guerrilla leadership who, for years, had resisted one of the world’s most sophisticated war machines.” The remainder of Gelinas’s charges suffer a like fate, according to eyewitnesses who were not, like Gelinas, living behind what Hughes calls “the barred entrance of the walled-off Western style Alexandre-de-Rhodes center.”






[107](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt107). Recall that this claim is expressly denied by numerous independent observers, cited above. It is worth noting, perhaps, Gelinas’s statement that “the churches have never been fuller,” contradicting the claims of the other media favorite, Nguyen Cong Hoan; but this is because “many Vietnamese find solace in prayer.” The contradictions on this score between Gelinas and Hoan have not troubled the journalists and editors who cite them both as giving the true picture of life in Vietnam, an interesting example of the ability of the faithful to tolerate counterevidence. According to Hughes, Gelinas told him: “people were ordered to have a good Christmas [in December, 1975], to have religious services.” There was no written order, he added in response to questioning, but local authorities “gave the churches Christmas trees. To show the world, you see.”

[114](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt114). Recall a point that is quite significant in this connection. Gelinas was completely unknown. His various accounts cite no evidence or documentation, and their credibility therefore depends entirely on his credibility, as judged by comments of his that are subject to check. To appreciate properly the Western reaction to Gelinas, consider the following hypothetical case: imagine that Russian forces were driven out of Hungary next year, and that a Russian who had worked for many years in a Russian cultural center in Hungary came forward in the Soviet Union, deploring the situation in Hungary after liberation without citing any evidence that could be checked, offering reports that are entirely at variance with eyewitness accounts of others during the same period, and describing Hungary under Russian rule as a land of freedom and wealth, now suffering under the yoke of an oppressor. Under such hypothetical circumstances, no one familiar with the Soviet propaganda system would be surprised to discover that his reports receive wide publicity and much acclaim and are used by editorialists as a club to beat Russian dissidents who denounced Russian rule in Hungary, the 1956 invasion, etc. The Western treatment of Gelinas is quite comparable, and once again gives an insight into the workings of the Free Press.






[115](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt115). He is predictably silent on the decimation of southern forces by the United States.






[116](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt116). Gelinas tells us little about his ministrations to his flock during his years in Vietnam. An American visitor to the bookstore he ran remembers him as “the only priest who was a hawk and who seemed more interested in business than in religious matters. Books of the neutralist Third Force were not sold in his store, but he did have a government monopoly on all translations of government books into Western languages.” Jon Steinberg, op. cit. (see note 94). Gelinas’s bitterness towards the government that forced him to leave is understandable, Steinberg adds, while “Those who print his stories as truth have less excuse.”






[117](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt117). See note 83. Recall that Fraser interviewed non-Communist activists who had defended political prisoners under the Thieu regime and who, contrary to what Paringaux wrote, had not “now become silent” but expressed their support for the general policies of the regime. Fraser’s account also conflicts with the well-publicized French reports in other significant respects. His reaction to their reports appears in part four of his seven-part series, 28 November 1978.

October 28, 29, citing reports by four French journalists who recently spent 10 days [in Saigon], gaining the most extensive access of any Western reporters since 1975.” The New York Times was then on strike. Both CBS and Browning refer to Le Monde as a left-wing newspaper, but otherwise, their reports were generally accurate.











The editorial is about what one would expect in a journal that not long ago was featuring discussions by one of its saner commentators (Joseph Harsch) on the relative merits of bombing trucks and dams (the latter so much more satisfying to the pilots, who come home “with a feeling of accomplishment” when they see the waters “pour through the breach and drown out huge areas of farm land, and villages, in its path” and so much more effective in “hurt[ing] people”).
