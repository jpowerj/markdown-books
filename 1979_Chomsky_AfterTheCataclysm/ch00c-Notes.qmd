No force on earth can separate us from that commitment,” which is “the soul of our foreign policy.” Presumably, the force that has separated us from that commitment in Iran, Indonesia, the Philippines and elsewhere is extra-terrestrial.

Thus the Washington Post commented editorially that while the Vietnamese invasion “was not, of course, a direct response to Sen. McGovern” (who had called for military intervention several months before), nonetheless “it probably did arise in part from a perception that Pol Pot’s demise would be accepted as a deliverance in every corner of the international community except Peking”—as it was by the Post. Editorial, “Phnom Penh falls,” 9 January 1979.

[10](../Text/Preface.html#Preface-Txt10). Jay Mathews, “Sihanouk: ‘We Were Privileged, Compared to the Rest,’” Washington Post (9 January 1979).











According to a direct transcript of the tape that we have received from journalists who were present, the omitted material reads: “If you allow me to speak about the common people, the common people, food, cooking: the cooking is good, clean, clean. The dining rooms are clean. They have good hygiene, Asian hygiene...” Sihanouk added that “the conditions of life are good. At the beginning, yes, we were in difficulty because of the war, the revenge of the war. But now it is good! Now? Before the conquest of our country by the Vietnamese the conditions were good, were good, I can say, I can assure you.”











We have kept in the text to the rendition of Sihanouk’s remarks that appeared in the U.S. press. These are not always exactly accurate, according to the transcript, but they convey the sense accurately, though many of Sihanouk’s more favorable comments concerning the regime do not appear. Thus he said that “I would like to see my government, the government of my country, presided over by Pol Pot and the Communist Party of Cambodia...it is right of the Pol Pot regime to do what they have done, since the people accept their status...I do not pretend to say that they have violated human rights. Perhaps they are right, I don’t know. Sincerely, I do not know. I have not the right to condemn them. I could not condemn them.” Responding to a question from Fox Butterfield of the New York Times, Sihanouk made it clear that he opposed the internal regimentation, lack of communication, and other restrictions. But though “my conscience is not in agreement with my friends the Khmers Rouges,...it seems to me that the majority of the people agree with Pol Pot and his team so far as the regime is concerned. In fact—there is it seems a better social justice. Why? Because the rich, there are no more rich, and the poor, they are less poor, so there is a movement of unification of Cambodian society. There is no rich, there is no poor. This is, I think, what pleases the Cambodian people—I say. I think the majority...I think there are some disadvantages. But for the poorest I think there are advantages, because you know their houses are better—their food is better.”

[12](../Text/Preface.html#Preface-Txt12). Norodom Sihanouk, address to the UN Security Council, representing Democratic Kampuchea, Guardian (New York), 24 January 1979. The week before the Guardian had reprinted the entire program of the Kampuchean National United Front for National Survival (KNUFNS; the Khmer group placed in power by the Vietnamese). It is remarkable that one has to turn to the tiny Marxist-Leninist press to find a record of such documents in the media.

The report describes families who are seriously undernourished while high-quality wheat that they cannot afford to buy is stored “in sheds and warehouses all over the country.” This is not an atrocity by Western standards, but rather a difficult problem yet to be solved.

[20](../Text/Preface.html#Preface-Txt20). In an accompanying article in the same issue of the Southeast Asia Chronicle (see note 19), Heder reviews the history of the delineation of the border, which had been readjusted by the French to the detriment of Cambodia for two main reasons: Cambodia was only a protectorate while Cochinchina (approximately the southern third of re-united Vietnam) was a full colony viewed by the French “as literally French territory”; “The commercial agricultural interests of the French colonists in Cochinchina were much stronger and much better organized than those in Kampuchea,” and therefore were able to impel the French imperial rulers to adjust the boundary in their favor. As a result, many ethnic Khmer areas were included in Cochinchina.






[21](../Text/Preface.html#Preface-Txt21). It was certainly obvious to any visitor to Hanoi during the war. The Vietnamese, while clearly trying to maintain a balance in the Sino-Soviet dispute and to contribute to healing it if possible, went out of their way to express their concern over potential Chinese expansionism, often rather symbolically, for example, by elaborate references to much earlier history.

William Chapman, “Cambodian resistance builds,” Washington Post (18 January 1979) citing a “source” who reports that “The Vietnamese have the towns, and the Cambodians have the countryside” and reporting surprise by “informed sources” in Bangkok at the “swiftness with which [guerrilla counter-attack] has flourished in so many places.” Richard Nations, “Pol Pot Forces Regroup, Harass Vietnamese in Cambodian Countryside,” Washington Post (26 January 1979) and “Major Khmer Rouge Attacks on Vietnamese Yield Success,” Ibid., (31 January 1979), reporting that the Vietnamese hold “an almost empty strategic shell” while the Khmer Rouge move with considerable freedom “among the population in the countryside,” with serious fighting throughout much of the country: “the Khmer Rouge appear to have ‘jerked the anvil out from under the Vietnamese hammer blow,’ in the words of one veteran Indochina analyst” while another estimates that 60,000 men have regrouped in large units of the Cambodian army; “rice has had to be airlifted into Battambang and Siem Reap—the traditional granaries of Cambodia—a good indication that the Vietnamese either cannot move into the countryside or find no food when they arrive” and that “the Khmer Rouge appear to have denied their enemies the stocks of fuel and food the Vietnamese appear to have been counting on”; “It now looks like a far longer, bloodier and more expensive operation than Hanoi probably counted on,” one observer said. See also Henry Kamm, “Vietnamese Army Is Said to Face Vigorous Cambodian Resistance,” New York Times (2 February 1979).

[31](../Text/Preface.html#Preface-Txt31). The standard assumption of the Western media is that “the Khmer Rouge government in Cambodia was presumably hated by almost everybody” (London Economist, 27 January 1979). This was written at the same time that Western intelligence was issuing analyses of the sort indicated in note 28. The Economist adds that “the Khmers Rouges are physically isolated from a source of supplies to a degree that Vietnam never was after the early days of the French war.” That is accurate, and may lead to the crushing of resistance whatever the actual level of popular support may be, a question that is considerably more open than the standard line of the media indicates.

1 The Setting






[1](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt1). For details concerning this remarkable episode, see N. Chomsky, “The Peace Hoax,” Liberation, January 1973: “Endgame: the tactics of peace in Vietnam,” Ramparts, April 1973; “Reporting Indochina: the news media and the legitimation of lies,” Social Policy, September-October 1973. On the history of the negotiations and their aftermath, see Gareth Porter, A Peace Denied, Indiana, 1975.






[2](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt2). Cf. AP, “U.S. Trade Embargo Against Hanoi Quietly Extended by President,” Washington Post, 14 September 1978: “President Carter, rebuffing persistent signals of friendship from Vietnam, is quietly extending the U.S. trade embargo against Hanoi.” Officials concede that there are “sound economic arguments for lifting the embargo,” since “trade with Vietnam could help cut back on the U.S. trade deficit.” But the importance of punishing the Vietnamese and internal political considerations far outweigh these concerns.






[3](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt3). On these matters, see Gabriel Kolko, The Politics of War, Random House, 1969; Joyce and Gabriel Kolko, The Limits of Power, Harper & Row, 1972. On the United States and the European labor movement, see Ronald Radosh, American Labor and United States Foreign Policy, Random House, 1969; Alfred W. McCoy et al., The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia, Harper & Row, 1972, chapter 2; Fred Hirsch and Richard Fletcher, CIA and the Labour Movement, Spokesman, 1977; Roy Godson, American Labor and European Politics, Crane, Russak, & Co., 1976. This last work, based on internal AFL documents, explains how the AFL exploited postwar starvation to transfer power to its own associates by keeping food from their opponents, employed gangsters as strike breakers to split the labor movement, undermined efforts of French labor to block shipments to the French forces attempting to reconquer Indochina, and so on. All of this is presented in glowing terms as a great humanitarian achievement in defense of democracy, liberty, and a free trade union movement.

[12](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt12). Snepp, op. cit., p. 568. This book should be read with caution. Though Snepp resigned from the CIA and is critical of U.S. errors, he writes completely within the general framework of the state propaganda system and, despite his alleged expertise, repeatedly offers propaganda fabrications as fact. For example, Snepp repeats standard myths with regard to the North Vietnamese land reform and the Hue massacre (pp. 211, 354); his account suffers further from internal inconsistency in the numbers game. See Volume I, chapter 5, sections 2.2, 2.3. See also chapter 2, footnote 9, below.






[13](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt13). 4 May 1977. The same editorial laments that the Northerners who “are streaming down to manage the reconstruction” are “dispersing the discontented middle classes, appropriating the consumer goods while denouncing them as alien”; while in Cambodia, Communist purges are “said to have taken hundreds of thousands of lives” and in “lovely little Laos,...the elites are fleeing to Thailand.” We return below to the question of how the Times reacted when it learned that “lovely little Laos” was being “secretly” bombed by the state it serves and to the alleged facts in this editorial about “what we have learned.”






[14](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt14). See Volume I, chapter 5. The media do most of their editorializing in what are called “news reports,” a far more effective device since propaganda is disguised as objective fact. Thus in a column by Times Asia correspondent Fox Butterfield we read that “the Communist victory last year and the coming formal unification evidently have made the fiction of a separate southern movement no longer necessary,” New York Times (25 April 1976). That the separate southern movement was a fiction was, of course, a staple of U.S. propaganda, dutifully repeated by obedient journalists though rejected by many serious analysts; Bernard Fall, for example. Typically the Times simply intones government propaganda without qualification. Times correspondents could hardly be expected to take note of the fact that the southern movement, however one may debate its status, was destroyed by the U.S. aggression that the Times supported; how much more convenient to exploit this consequence as proof that it was a fiction no longer needed by the devious communists.






[15](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt15). John Pilger, “Vietnam: Do not weep for those just born,” New Statesman, 15 September 1978; Canadian officials reported by 1965 that Vinh, a city of 60,000, had been flattened; cf. Fall, Last Reflections, pp. 232-33. See Jean and Simonne Lacouture. Vietnam: voyage à travers une victoire, Seuil, 1976, for a graphic eyewitness description of the extent and character of the damage to property and persons throughout Vietnam. The literature on the consequences of the U.S. war is substantial. See, among others, E.S. Herman, Atrocities in Vietnam: Myths and Realities, Pilgrim Press, 1970; J.B. Neiland, et al., Harvest of Death, Free Press, 1972; J.C. Pomonti, La Rage d’etre Vietnamien, Seuil, 1974; and many other sources.






[16](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt16). Internal documents, in contrast, make it clear that the United States explicitly intended, from immediately after the “disaster” of the Geneva Accords, to use military force “to defeat local Communist subversion or rebellion not constituting armed attack,” in direct defiance of the “supreme law of the land” which restricts the use of force to self-defense against armed attack, and to extend the use of such force elsewhere, including China, if need be. NSC 5429/2, August 1954. These crucial and explicit recommendations were too hot to handle for the Pentagon Papers historians, who seriously misrepresented the contents of the document, and they are consistently ignored by academic scholarship, no doubt for similar reasons. Cf. For Reasons of State, pp. 100f.






[17](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt17). Despite the massive destruction caused by the war, the NLF-PRG nevertheless was able to play a substantial role to the end. See, for example, the eyewitness report of the capture of Quang Ngai by southern PRG forces, with barely a shot being fired, by Earl S. Martin, a Mennonite social worker in Vietnam who was fluent in Vietnamese; Reaching the Other Side, Crown, 1978. The press generally referred only to a North Vietnamese invasion.






[18](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt18). See Volume I, chapter 5, section 1.2. See also London Economist, “The bottle stayed corked,” 13 May 1978: “The original purpose of that long, inefficient war was to keep Indochina as the ‘cork in the bottle’” (our emphasis). The choice of adjective is revealing: would the Economist speak of the German bombing of England merely as “inefficient”? The distinction reflects the deep racist and imperialist assumptions that permeate Western liberal thought. We return directly to the quite comparable “pragmatic” opposition to the war on the part of U.S. “doves.”











For detailed analysis of this strategy, based on internal documents, see For Reasons of State, chapter 1, section V; also R.B. DuBoff, “Business ideology and foreign policy,” in The Pentagon Papers, Gravel edition, vol. 5, N. Chomsky and H. Zinn, eds., Critical Essays, Beacon, 1972. The rational imperial planning that always lay behind the U.S. intervention in Vietnam has been effectively written out of history by U.S. scholars, as inconsistent with the image of U.S. benevolence (or perhaps, “tragic error”) that “responsible scholarship” must convey. For some recent discussion see Chomsky, ‘Human Rights’ and American Foreign Policy, Spokesman, 1978; Intellectuals and the State, Het Wereldvenster, 1978.






[19](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt19). This scandalous policy is based in part on rational imperial strategy, and in part simply on chauvinist pique of the sort expressed by Asian scholar Robert Scalapino of Berkeley, who said in Hong Kong that “We Americans have got used to the idea of aiding those we defeat in war, but I find it unacceptable for the U.S. to aid a country which has defeated us.” Far Eastern Economic Review, 15 July 1977.

[21](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt21). For discussion of these matters, see N. Chomsky, American Power and the New Mandarins, Pantheon, 1969; ‘Human Rights’ and American Foreign Policy. See Charles Kadushin, The American Intellectual Elite, Little, Brown, 1974, for detailed analysis of attitudes of a certain group of intellectuals towards the war.

[23](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt23). We cannot take the space here to explore the astonishing comparison between the support of volunteers for the Spanish Loyalists against Franco’s Moroccan army backed by military forces from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, with U.S. government intervention to impose and support client fascism in South Vietnam. Notice how, in Peters’ account, the U.S. military forces that were bombing South Vietnamese before we “began to go wrong” in 1965 have become “volunteers” who were “help[ing] the South.” By the term “South,” Peters is referring to the client regime established by the United States, not the people of South Vietnam, who, as U.S. analysts at the time and later were well aware, had little use for the U.S. creation and to a substantial extent supported the NLF (about half the population, according to U.S. analysts, a higher proportion than supported the American rebels in the revolutionary war; see chapter 2, section 2).

[27](../Text/Chapter1.html#Chapter1-Txt27). The real ends of U.S. intervention in Indochina, as disclosed by state documents, indicate an almost total amorality and willingness to use force in complete disregard of law to achieve balance of power and economic objectives. Democracy, independence, self-determination and the welfare of Indochina were useful manipulative symbols, but their relevance to policy decisions of U.S. leaders approached zero in value.

They have yet to comment on their confident prediction that “all” of the millions of people who fought against the Communists would be slaughtered, their reason for supporting the U.S. “intervention,” which by 1964 already involved major U.S. military activities, massive forced-population removal, and other atrocities.

They explain that while they do not accept the premises of the question, others are raising it, so that it should be discussed; evidently, they consider it a serious question, worthy of discussion.

On the so-called “McCarthyite period,” a term that minimizes the role of cold war liberals, see David Caute, The Great Fear: the Anti-Communist Purge under Truman and Eisenhower, Simon and Schuster, 1978; Mary S. McAuliffe, Crisis on the Left: Cold war Politics and American Liberals, 1947-1954, University of Massachusetts, 1978; Robert J. Goldstein, Political Repression in Modern America, Schenkman, 1978. See also Richard M. Freeland, The Truman Doctrine and the Origins of McCarthyism, Knopf, 1972; Michael P. Rogin, The Intellectuals and McCarthy: the Radical Specter, MIT, 1967. On the extensive and quite effective repression by the national political police (FBI) during the 1960s, see Morton H. Halperin et al., The Lawless State, Penguin, 1976; N. Blackstock, ed., COINTELPRO, Random House, 1976; Dave Dellinger, More Power than We Know. Doubleday, 1975. The scale of FBI activities can be appreciated from one minor revelation. In civil suits charging the FBI with illegal surveillance it was revealed by the Bureau that in the Chicago office alone—one of 59 field offices—there were 3,207 linear feet of files under the “subversive” and “extremist” classifications, an estimated 7.7 million pages. From 1966 the Chicago FBI office paid out more than $2.5 million to 5,145 informants. These classifications do not include sedition, sabotage, or other criminal investigative files. In the “subversive” classification there are such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union; under “extremists” we find CORE, NAACP, the Afro-American Patrolmen’s League, Rev. Jesse Jackson’s operation PUSH, etc. Rob Warden, Washington Post (9 April 1978). The Chicago documents also acknowledge an FBI break-in at the offices of the Chicago Committee to Defend the Bill of Rights, which was formed during the “McCarthy” period to oppose government repression. Washington Post, AP (21 January 1978). On the efforts of the FBI in Chicago to incite murder of Black leaders and their involvement in political assassination when these efforts failed, see the references cited above. FBI surveillance was the least significant of the disruptive and often violent acts initiated by the Federal Government as opposition to its policies developed. On the “staggering dimensions” of FBI actions to ruin the personal lives of dissenters, foment violence, etc. see William M. Kunstler, “Writers of the Purple Page,” Nation, 30 December 1978.

See for example the New Republic editorial, 29 April 1978, a defense of Carter against criticism which is coupled with a complaint that he and his advisers have only “vague notions about the East-West conflict which remains the central fact of international relations today.” The editors continue: “We thought we saw the beginnings of a coherent strategy in Carter’s ‘tough’ talk several weeks ago at Winston-Salem, North Carolina. But then the neutron bomb decision indicated that the president had been only talking.”

He provides authoritative evidence that, despite the claims of Carter and the mass media, Soviet intervention in Angola followed that of the United States (pp. 66-67). He resigned in protest from the CIA after Katangese based in Angola invaded their native province in Zaire (apparently, with considerable local support). According to Stockwell, the CIA had warned of such retaliation if the United States persisted in supporting attacks on Angola mounted from Zaire, but the warning was ignored by Kissinger, who seems to have been interested in developing an international confrontation with the Russians as his efforts to subvert the Paris agreements collapsed in Vietnam. Cf. John Stockwell, “Why I am Leaving the CIA,” Washington Post (10 April 1977). See Seymour M. Hersh, “Kissinger-Colby Briefings on C.I.A. Called Misleading by Senate Panel,” New York Times (16 July 1978), on how Kissinger and Colby “misled Congress about the extent of the Central Intelligence Agency’s activities in the 1975 civil war in Angola, according to sources with first-hand knowledge”—to put it more bluntly, lied to Congress, the least significant but most discussed element of this sordid affair.

Cooper et al., The American Experience with Pacification in Vietnam: an Overview of Pacification, NTIS, U.S. Department of Commerce, March 1972, a study of pacification commissioned by the Pentagon and undertaken by the Institute for Defense Analysis, a university-based consortium, which “derives doctrinal and operational lessons from the US experience with pacification in South Vietnam to guide US policy-makers in providing technical assistance and advice in the future to a friendly government facing an internal security problem.” The study explains the problems caused, for example, by the threat of “political struggle” from 1956 (13), and later, “the vast swarms of refugees from Viet Cong controlled or bombed-out villages” (xvi; “most [refugees fled] from battle-ravaged and bomb-destroyed hamlets and villages” (48), which confounded “American and Vietnamese humanitarian efforts” (xvi)), and by the “local bully boys...[who]...have made Saigon into a seething social jungle”(49). Other problems are caused by “our strong sense of social justice and morality” which leads us to take over programs best left to the friendly government (43). Some of the techniques suggested “should be tried on a pilot basis in one or two other insurgency situations (e.g., the Philippines)” (61).

The practice continues. A case recently exposed by the Senate Committee on Intelligence involves the Penkovsky Papers, actually “prepared and written by witting Agency assets who drew on actual case materials” and “sold to a publisher through a trust fund established for the purpose,” the publisher remaining “unaware of any U.S. Government interest.” Cited from the Senate report by Stephen S. Rosenfeld, Washington Post (30 April 1976). Rosenfeld was expelled from Moscow in protest over publication of the CIA fabrication in the Post. The Russians alleged—correctly, as we now discover—that the book was a “coarse fraud, a mixture of provocative invention and anti-Soviet slander” (Rosenfeld). The book’s “editor,” Frank Gibney, pledged that proceeds would go to a fund “to further the cause of genuine peace and friendship between the American and Russian peoples,” which must have caused a few laughs in CIA and KGB circles.






[9](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt9). See Volume I, chapter 5, section 2.2. What is remarkable is not so much that Chi’s account was believed at the time, but that belief persists even after the exposures, as we discussed. See particularly note 168, discussing Guenter Lewy’s parody of scholarship. In this case, the intelligence fabrications may well have deluded the CIA as well. Snepp, who is described on the jacket of his book as “the agency’s principal analyst of North Vietnamese political affairs,” refers to “some 30,000 to 50,000 intransigent peasants and landowners...killed or imprisoned” in the land reform program of the mid-1950s (p. 354). The fact that he offers one of the more restrained estimates suggests, however, that he may be continuing to purvey the myth, rather than expressing his belief in it.

[10](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt10). Portrait of a Cold Warrior, Putnam, 1976. A defense of the CIA, the book is not devoted to an exposure of its practices. Nevertheless, it contains much of interest, including an account of electoral manipulation in the Philippines, the anti-Castro crusade (which, he claims, was being escalated by Kennedy just before his death but was reduced in scale by Johnson), and other matters. As for the more humanitarian aspects of U.S. policy, Smith concludes that “despite the idealistic Alianza para el Progreso prattle, U.S. policy and CIA activities in Latin America were shaped by U.S. business interests and investments.” This conclusion, produced in reference to the CIA’s role in putting Frei into office in Chile in 1964, is interesting because of its source, though hardly novel.

[12](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt12). See, for example, John K. Fairbank, “Our Vietnam tragedy,” Newsletter, Harvard Graduate Society for Advanced Study and Research, June 1975. He writes that “a factor of ignorance” lies at the source of “our Vietnam tragedy.” We did not realize that the Vietnamese revolution was “inspired by the sentiment of nationalism” and we misguidedly “embarked on an anti-nationalist effort,” and later misconceived “our role in defending the South after 1965,” conceiving it as aimed at blocking aggression from North Vietnam and “forestalling a southward expansion of Chinese Communism.” A judicious scholar, he also remarks that our “greatly accelerating the urbanization of Vietnam” after 1965 was “not necessarily to our credit or to the benefit of the South Vietnamese,” referring to the policy of bombing the population into the cities to destroy the rural society and thus deprive the NLF of its support. See also Edwin O. Reischauer (“Back to Normalcy,” Foreign Policy, Fall, 1975), who also claims that the U.S. government was unaware of the nationalist character of the Viet Minh and its successors: “The real lesson of the Vietnam war is the tremendous cost of attempting to control the destiny of a South-east Asian country against the cross-currents of nationalism”—the cost to us, that is. To thoroughly appreciate the character of this historical nonsense (putting aside its moral level), one must recognize that Fairbank and Reischauer are the “deans” of Asian scholarship, with solid liberal credentials.

[15](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt15). This phrase is the propaganda term, invariably applied by the press and scholarship, to the client regime installed by the United States in South Vietnam; useful in its implication of a positive connection with the population rather than the actuality of a minority instrument of a foreign power.






[16](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt16). On occasion, alert reporters commented on the fabrications. For example, Daniel Southerland cabled from Saigon “that so far he has been unable to verify reports of executions of officials and others in occupied areas. Mr. Southerland does report cables from the U.S. embassy in Saigon to Washington reporting alleged executions, but says one monk supposed to be an eyewitness is nowhere to be found. Another alleged eyewitness in Da Nang told Mr. Southerland he had seen no such thing. The embassy’s cables have the apparent aim of persuading Congress to vote more aid, Mr. Southerland reports.” Interpolated in Godfrey Sperling Jr., “Will Saigon become election issue?” Christian Science Monitor (21 April 1975).






[17](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt17). Snepp, op. cit. pp. 301f. This operation, in which Britain and Australia also played a part, was described by Richard West as a “nauseating charade...this sudden concern for orphans is the most disgusting sham I have witnessed in nine years in Vietnam” (New Statesmen, 11 April 1975). Martin Woollacott described it as “one of the most hideous aspects of these last days of Saigon—the way in which children are suddenly being used as a propaganda weapon...the orphanages of Saigon are now being scoured by people whose only purpose is to make some kind of capital out of the present situation” (Manchester Guardian Weekly, 12 April 1975). The Vatican accused the United States “of engaging in international kidnapping, abusing the children for propagandistic purposes and engaging in a national ‘guilt trip’ to compensate for America’s role in Southeast Asia” (New York Times, 13 April 1975). A group of Buddhist orphanages denounced the “exploitation of the orphans for political aims”; the airlift “has stirred great sympathy among Americans but it has raised a storm of protest in Vietnam itself” (Daniel Southerland, Christian Science Monitor, 23 April 1975). The Red Cross condemned the operation as contrary to the Geneva conventions and the Buddhist An Quang Pagoda called it “a shameful act” (Washington Post, 10 April 1975). Many non-Communists in Saigon called it “a ‘criminal act’ akin to kidnapping,” while the effort of the Daily Mail (London) “to get in on the orphan act” by rounding up orphans was called “a grotesque stunt” (H.D.S. Greenway, Washington Post, 15 April 1978). “...most Vietnamese reacted with anger at the American babylift last week” while Deputy Prime Minister Phan Quang Dan admitted that “it was a good way to get sympathy for additional American aid to Vietnam,” noting that Ambassador Martin had “intervened personally” to send the orphans abroad so as to “help swing American public opinion to the advantage of the Republic of Vietnam” (Fox Butterfield, New York Times, 13 April 1975). Jane Barton, a Vietnamese-speaking staff worker of the AFSC, interviewed children who said that they were not orphans but had been separated from their parents in refugee camps and then flown to the United States. They reported that families were arbitrarily broken up with children sent to different countries; in three visits to orphans arriving in San Francisco she did not meet one child who had lost both parents (AFSC report, 14 April 1975). Desmond Smith, director of CBC TV in Montreal, described the “body snatching” as perhaps the most “revolting” act yet in the war. He quotes a Canadian relief worker who describes it as “like getting meat in a meat market.” He points out further that up to two months before it “was not fashionable” to save real orphans, and also discusses the disgusting spectacle of Americans who would not dream of saving an orphan from a U.S. ghetto or a Calcutta slum but who now just must have a Vietnamese child kidnapped from Saigon: “The final indignity for the Vietnamese is that after we have bombed, strafed, napalmed and maimed half the population, we now take their children from them” (Nation, 19 April 1975). The actual evacuation was described by a doctor aboard the chartered Pan-Am aircraft as “the most incredible scene of deprivation and illness I’ve ever seen.” Children suffered from dehydration, pneumonia, diarrhea and viral disease, while staff members on the aircraft were running out of liquids to treat dehydration cases (Douglas Kneeland, New York Times, 7 April 1975). A year later, the Washington Post reported (25 April 1976) that only nine of over 2,000 “orphans” had been legally adopted, because it turned out that perhaps 2/3 are not orphans (Nation, 8 May 1976). In a San Francisco court, court-appointed experts testified that 18 of 25 randomly selected “babylift” children were illegally removed from Vietnam by private adoption agencies, many with parents who had signed no release. Sixty-nine are being given a fundamentalist Christian upbringing in a Baptist church where the pastor refuses repatriation to their parents because “Vietnam is communist now” (Liberation News Service, Guardian, New York, 26 November 1975). See also, Richard Flaste, New York Times (9 April 1975); Judith Coburn, “The War of the Babies,” Village Voice (14 April 1975); Gloria Emerson, “Operation Babylift,” New Republic, 26 April 1975. Among the more sordid scenes in this squalid affair was the sight of President Ford tearfully welcoming “orphans” and Hugh Hefner’s “Big Bunny” flying 40 orphans to the United States to be carried off the plane by Playboy bunnies (Washington Post, 10 April 1975).






[18](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt18). The Times refused to open its letters column to comments on this interesting gambit, though it published quite a wide range of responses to the editorial, including even a call for nuclear war. One letter that was not published, our own, read as follows:






An editorial in the Times, April 5, observes that “a decade of fierce polemics has failed to resolve this ongoing quarrel” between two contending views: that “the war to preserve a non-Communist, independent South Vietnam could have been waged differently,” and that “a viable, non-Communist South Vietnam was always a myth.” There has also been a third position: That apart from its prospects for success, the United States has neither the authority nor competence to intervene in the internal affairs of Vietnam. This was the position of much of the authentic peace movement, that is, those who opposed the war because it was wrong, not merely because it was unsuccessful. It is regrettable that this position is not even a contender in the debate, as the Times sees it.






On a facing page, Donald Kirk observes that “since the term ‘bloodbath’ first came into vogue in the Indochinese conflict, no one seems to have applied it to the war itself—only to the possible consequences of ending the war.” He is quite wrong. Many Americans involved in the authentic peace movement have insisted for years on the elementary point that he believes has been noticed by “no one,” and it is a commonplace in literature on the war. To mention just one example, we have written a small book on the subject (Counter-revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact and Propaganda, 1973), though in this case the corporation (Warner Brothers) that owned the publisher refused to permit distribution after publication. But quite apart from this, the observation has been made repeatedly in discussion and literature on the war, by just that segment of opinion that the Times editorial excludes from the debate.






[19](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt19). Among the most persuasive examples of the subservience of the press are those that it regards as its proudest moments; e.g., Watergate, a fact that is obvious enough if one looks just a bit below the surface.

[22](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt22). Braestrup succeeds in portraying the media as unduly “pessimistic” by extensive fabrication of evidence and misrepresentation of his own documents, as is shown in detail in N. Chomsky, “The U.S. Media and the Tet Offensive,” Race and Class, XX, 1978; large parts appear in More, June 1978. See the same review for documentation on the subjects of this paragraph. Reviews and comment in the New York Times and Washington Post lauded this incompetent and hopelessly inaccurate work as “one of the major pieces of investigative reporting and first-rate scholarship of the past quarter century,” a “conscientious” and “painstakingly thorough study,” etc.






[23](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt23). Cf. Saburo Ienaga, The Pacific War, Pantheon, 1978, pp. 236f. Ienaga’s book is primarily a critique of Japanese fascism, aggression and atrocities. His documentation of crimes of the U.S. occupying army has yet to be mentioned in a review in the United States, to our knowledge. In the U.S. colony in the Philippines, meanwhile, the United States was engaged in dismantling the popular peasant-based anti-Japanese resistance and restoring to power the wealthy elites that collaborated successively with the U.S. occupiers, the Japanese, and then again the United States. In the course of these operations, U.S. military forces took part in a massacre of 109 peasant guerrillas who were rounded up, ordered to dig a mass grave, then shot “with the knowledge and consent of American [Counterintelligence Corps] officers present at the time.” The perpetrator of the massacre was then appointed mayor by the United States. Benedict J. Kerkvliet, The Huk Rebellion, University of California Press, 1977, p. 113, a valuable study of the origins of the Huk rebellion in peasant discontent intensified by U.S. colonialism, suppressed with the aid of U.S. military intelligence headed by Major Lansdale, later of Vietnam fame, regarded in the United States as a deep thinker with great insight into the peasant mind but in fact a typical colonialist fantasy-monger.

For details, see Stephen Salaff, “The Diary and the Cenotaph: Racial and Atomic Fever in the Canadian Record,” Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars, April-June 1978. The racist sentence was concealed until the lapse of a 30-year prohibition on the publication of secret government papers. The example illustrates rather well what is often considered “a state secret.” On the racism of Western leaders during World War II, see Christopher Thorne, Allies of a Kind, Oxford, 1978. One wonders how Canadian (or Western) historians will deal with a comparable revelation concerning Prime Minister Lester Pearson, who is highly regarded in the West for his humanism. In released but unpublished sections of the Pentagon Papers it is revealed that Pearson was approached by the U.S. government in mid-1964 when the bombing of North Vietnam was under close consideration in the hope that the DRV might exert its influence to restrain the southern forces that were preventing the U.S. conquest of the South. The Nobel Peace Prize winner replied that nuclear weapons would be excessive, but conventional bombing would be quite legitimate.

The American revolutionary war, Fall wrote, “entirely fits the bill of the many revolutionary wars which afflict the middle of the twentieth century...it was a military operation fought by a very small armed minority—at almost no time did Washington’s forces exceed 8,000 men in a country which had at least 300,000 able-bodied males—and backed by a force of 31,897 French ground troops, and 12,660 sailors and Marines manning sixty-one major vessels.” Last Reflections on a War, p. 276.

Another standard reference is John Adams’s estimate that 1/3 of the population supported the revolution, 1/3 opposed it, and 1/3 were neutral (Shy, 166). Shy’s own analysis leads him to the conclusion that “almost certainly a majority of the population, [the great middle group of Americans] were the people who were dubious, afraid, uncertain, indecisive” and unwilling to risk the hazards and suffering of revolutionary struggle; “the prudent, politically apathetic majority of white American males was not eager to serve actively in the militia” (pp. 215, 217).

He explains why in vivid detail, concluding that “heedless of theories, Americans began the building of their empire with an inheritance of ethnocentric semantics that made logic valid to themselves out of the strange proposition that invasion, conquest, and dispossession of other peoples support the principle that all men are created equal” (p. 344).

Benjamin Franklin, “after recounting the atrocities of the French and Indian wars,...called for the ‘extirpation’ of the French in Canada because of their manifold wickedness” (Shy, 238). Later, colonists raised an outcry against a 1774 act of the British Parliament concerning Quebec, stressing “the horrors of ‘Papacy,’ because it permitted Canada’s Catholics to worship without disturbance” (Jennings, op. cit., p. 339). “After the battles of Lexington and Concord,” Jennings continues, “the Second Constitutional Congress made an address to ‘the oppressed inhabitants of Canada,’ in which the Congress ‘perceived the fate of the protestant and catholic colonies to be strongly linked together’—so much for the popish menace—and appealed to the Canadians to overthrow the yoke of their ‘present form of tyranny.’ A few months later, the Congress’s armies invaded Quebec to confer the boon of liberty upon those poor, deserving Catholics” (340).

Compare his rather different approach to refugees in Timor from U.S.-backed Indonesian terror. (Volume I, chapter 3, section 4.4).






[51](../Text/Chapter2.html#Chapter2-Txt51). Though not as familiar as it should be, the treatment of Blacks and Indians after the war of independence is well enough known so that we need not recount it here. Recall that the first emancipation proclamation applying to American slaves was issued by the British in November, 1775, offering to free “all indentured servants, Negroes or others...able and willing to bear arms...” A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., In the Matter of Color, Oxford, 1978; excerpts in the Washington Post (21 May 1978). Slaveholders, in response, urged slaves to “be content with their situation, and expect a better condition in the next world.” Small wonder that thousands of Blacks joined the British forces, and “when the British left America at the end of the war, they carried thousands of blacks to freedom in Great Britain, the West Indies, Canada, and, eventually, Africa.” (Berlin, op. cit., pp. 353-55.)











An early draft of the American Declaration of Independence contained a condemnation of the slave trade, but this was deleted “in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia” (Jefferson). The British ridiculed the colonists for their protest against their alleged “enslavement” to England—their constant claim that “we are slaves” under British oppression (Josiah Quincy, and many others); see footnote 47. The rhetoric of the American revolutionaries was, however, used effectively by the abolitionists and others in later years. See Higginbotham, op. cit. Now a federal judge, Higginbotham was first impelled to study this subject, he writes, as a college student when his protest over the refusal to allow Black students to live in campus dormitories at Purdue University was met by the following response by President Edward Charles Elliott: “Higginbotham, the law doesn’t require us to let colored students in the dorm, and you either accept things as they are or leave the university immediately.’’ But in fairness we must add that this was, after all, only 160 years after liberation. Matters have since improved, as a result of the courageous struggles of Blacks in the 1950s and 1960s, but it is still possible for the state to murder Black leaders with impunity and imprison civil rights activists for long periods, with no public outcry and (in the latter case) no interest on the part of President Carter, whose concern for human rights looks selectively outward. See references of chapter 1, footnote 34 and Chomsky, ‘Human Rights’ and American Foreign Policy, pp. 69f.

3 Refugees: Indochina and Beyond






[1](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt1). 17 June 1978. The Laotians are largely Hmong Tribemen, organized by the CIA to fight against the Pathet Lao and then abandoned when they were no longer needed. (See chapter 1, section 1; and chapter 5.) By the end of the 1975-1978 period under review in this volume, the total number of refugees from Indochina remaining in Asia was estimated to be 333,500, including 150,000 refugees from Cambodia in Vietnam. Another 130,000 had been resettled in the United States, France, and elsewhere. These figures do not include the 135,000 airlifted from Vietnam by the United States in April 1975. Cited from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in the Los Angeles Times, 8 January 1979. On the causes of the accelerated flight of refugees from Vietnam in mid and late 1978, see the preface to this volume.






[2](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt2). The reference is presumably to East Asia.






[3](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt3). Among them are some 250,000 refugees from Zaire prior to the invasion of May, 1978, according to the UN High Commissioner for refugees, “mostly farmers who had arrived empty handed,” in some cases whole villages. “The Cold War in Africa,” Peace Press, London, July/August/September, 1978. The same report cites the observation of a Belgian refugee in the London Guardian (22 May 1978): “What the government troops did to the population down here after [the arrival of the Moroccan troops flown in by the French to expel the Katangese rebels in May 1978] was unbelievable. One whole village was massacred. Even the Moroccans...were disgusted.” President Mobutu of Zaire, maintained in power by French, Belgian and Moroccan forces backed by the United States, offered an amnesty to exiles from his rule. “Mobutu offers Amnesty to 200,000 Refugees,” Washington Post (25 June 1978). Upon their return, many thousands of these refugees were taken to detention centers, where they were subjected to interrogation and frequent beatings, all in “flagrant violations of the amnesty,” according to international officials on the scene.

In a rare reference to the flight of refugees from Burma, the Christian Science Monitor carried a Reuters dispatch from Bangladesh (16 November 1978) reporting that more than 5,000 of the Burmese Muslim refugees had been repatriated, though 190,000 “were still living in 13 improvised camps set up by the Bangladesh Government,” according to UN officials. In December 1978, one of the torrent of articles on refugees from Indochina then appearing mentioned the “bizarre tale of almost 200,000 Moslems who fled last May from Burma to Bangladesh ...” Richard M. Weintraub, “Asia’s Refugees: A New Wave of Human Migration,” Washington Post, 12 December 1978, the second of two long articles; most of the article was devoted to the refugees from Indochina, as was (in its entirety) the first article of the series the preceding day and a second article that also appeared on December 12. A third article on December 12 noted that at the UN meeting in Geneva devoted to “the Indochina refugee problem,” the U.S. government “called on governments around the world today to provide homes for the flood of Indochinese refugees.”






[6](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt6). See Volume I, chapter 4, section 1. In mid-July, China estimated the number of ethnic Chinese who fled Vietnam to China at 140,000. New York Times (15 July 1978). Later reports are higher; it seems that most ethnic Chinese were fleeing not to China but elsewhere in late 1978. Most of the increasing number of “boat people” in late 1978 are reported to be Chinese.

An analysis from Australia points out that there are many “doubts about identity” of refugees. A Catholic relief worker notes that “there have been white collar workers, public servants as well as army officers, who have said they were fishermen.” The Laotian and Cambodian refugees “come from a higher class, representing the ‘finest families imaginable,’” according to Berenice Lenze of the Indochinese Refugee Association. A large proportion of the refugees are Chinese—few of the Vietnamese who arrived even spoke Vietnamese. National Times (Australia), week ending 10 June 1978.

[10](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt10). See Jonathan C. Randal, Washington Post (20 March 1978). These are useful weapons against such targets as the Rashidiyeh Palestinian refugee camp, where “hours after the raid, an Israeli helicopter flew over the camp south of Tyre no more than 20 feet off the ground and was not fired upon” (Randal). The Israeli use of CBUs aroused some mild protest in the United States, presumably, on the grounds that only the United States has the right to use such weapons against defenseless people.

[12](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt12). Maariv, 16 May 1978. This emigration is important for Israel because of the “demographic problem” posed by the presence of Arabs in a Jewish state, a very substantial minority given the intention since 1967 to maintain control of large parts of the West Bank and Gaza. Much of the “emigration” is far from voluntary.

The estimate for Honduras is about 8,000 refugees in September. Clerc writes that the refugees who fled to Costa Rica had to escape through barbed wire laid by Nicaraguan armed forces and that those in Honduras are suffering severe deprivation despite assistance from Austria.

[18](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt18). Jon Nordheimer, “Illegal Tide of Haitians Arriving on U.S. Shore,” New York Times (18 July 1978). The report was occasioned by the arrival of 33 “boat people” who were “rounded up by the police.” It claims that Haitian “boat people” are no longer imprisoned and that “confusion over the changing regulations, meanwhile, has slowed down the deportation of Haitians unable to show that they were political refugees from a country with friendly ties with the United States” (our emphasis), always the crucial consideration.

Militant (1 September 1978), which also carries a report of a demonstration in Miami protesting “racist attacks” against Haitian refugees. The mainstream press rarely carries such news.






[21](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt21). The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service works in an interesting fashion. Its timing in the expulsion of victims of friendly tyrannies, for example, has a curious way of coinciding with union organizing. Thus in September, 1978, a group of Haitian custodians were arrested by INS just a day before contract negotiations for custodians were to begin. “The negotiations are now up in the air,” Martha Cooley reports; “I-Men Raid Quincy Market for Illegal Aliens, Impede Union Drives,” Real Paper, Cambridge (14 October 1978). This is one example of a pattern described in the article, mere coincidence according to INS.






[22](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt22). News conference, March 24, 1977; reprinted in the New York Times, March 25 without comment. Carter was asked by a CBS newsman whether the United States “has a moral obligation to help rebuild Vietnam.” At first he evaded the question. When it was reiterated he gave this response: we have no obligation because “the destruction was mutual.” Since “we went to Vietnam without any desire...to impose American will on other people” but only “to defend the freedom of the South Vietnamese,” there is no reason for us “to apologize or to castigate ourselves or to assume the status of culpability.” Nor do we “owe a debt.” One learns a good deal about the United States—indeed, the Free World—from the fact that such a statement made by the apostle of Human Rights can pass without notice.

[25](../Text/Chapter3.html#Chapter3-Txt25). The advisory board overturned the jury nominations in 5 of 10 cases. The others are also interesting. The prize for commentary went to William Safire, the extreme rightwing commentator of the New York Times, who was not even a finalist. The prize for editorial writing was awarded to Meg Greenfield of the Washington Post, who has specialized in urging a renewal of a harsher cold war stance, again overruling the jury recommendation. We have already discussed Kamm’s first published article after he received the Pulitzer Prize, namely, his report from Jakarta on Timor (Volume I, chapter 3, section 4.4).











4 Vietnam






[1](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt1). Recall the confident prediction of the editors of Dissent that all of those who fought the Communists would be slaughtered—i.e. many millions of people—tacitly reiterated again in the spring of 1975, but never specifically recalled since; see chapter 1 note 29. (See also Volume I, chapter 2, section 2.2.)






[2](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt2). Cited from Vietnam: If the Communists Won, Saigon, Vietnam Council on Foreign Relations, 1972, in The British Press and Vietnam, Indochina Information No. 3; written by a group of working journalists in the British media and published by the Indochina Solidarity Conference, 1973, the source of the background on this authority.






[3](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt3). New York Times (31 May 1978).






[4](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt4). Presumably, the source for the Tass dispatch is the Vietnam Press Agency, 26 January 1978, giving official statistics of 260,000 montagnards in the South of a total of 800,000 who have been resettled. Nayan Chanda, “Le communisme vietnamien en marche,” Le Monde diplomatique, April 1978. Chanda, regular Southeast Asia correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review, has been a perceptive commentator on affairs of the region for many years. His report of a visit to Vietnam in fact provides some basis for the claim made on purely a priori grounds in the New York Times. Certain montagnard areas, he writes, were closed to visits for security reasons, apparently because of montagnard discontent over the resettlement policy and the institution of Vietnamese as a common language for the whole country.






[5](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt5). Butterfield informed us that the wording in question was not his, but was added by “overly eager editing.” He apparently regards it as accurate, however, as we see directly.

[11](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt11). But there have been protests, for example by the French anthropologist Georges Condominas, who worked with hill tribes that were virtually wiped out by U.S.-backed atrocities. (We Have Eaten the Forest, Allen Lane, 1977, introduction). In fact, the Vietnamese Communists seem to have a far better record than the various U.S.-imposed regimes in dealing with the hill tribes, and while many montagnards allied themselves with the United States (much as American Indians did with the British) because of fear of any Vietnamese, others fought with the Communists. For example, the capture of Ban Me Thuot, which began the final 1975 offensive, was reported by an escaped Catholic priest to have involved local montagnards but no North Vietnamese troops. Cf. Washington Post (15 March 1975), cited by Buttinger, Vietnam: the Unforgettable Tragedy, p. 150.






[12](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt12). See Chomsky, For Reasons of State, pp. 84f. for explicit recommendations on generating refugees, from the highest sources. See also pp. 5f. and elsewhere for relevant background.






[13](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt13). Butterfield states that the purposes of the resettlement program are “to relieve the major unemployment problem in parts of the south, to overcome chronic food shortages in the north by opening new farmland and to improve police control of the population by moving malcontent members of the bourgeoisie out of the cities.” He makes no reference to the “cost in human terms” of leaving millions of people to starve in the cities to which they were driven by U.S. programs of “forced-draft urbanization” and “modernization” (Harvard Professor Samuel Huntington’s euphemism for bombing the rural population into U.S.-controlled cities; cf. Chomsky, At War with Asia, pp. 54f.).






[14](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt14). Butterfield is, in fact, one of the more serious U.S. correspondents writing about Southeast Asia, and the New York Times, apart from its national stature, is perhaps on the liberal side of the narrow spectrum of the U.S. media. In the admittedly rather silly Freedom House study of the press discussed above, p. 34, the Times is described as an “antiwar journal.” See Volume I, chapter 2, note 101, for the consequences of its allegedly “leftist” positions, as perceived by U.S. business interests.






[15](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt15). Butterfield writes that “many highly trained and educated southerners, between 50,000 and 100,000, analysts estimate, remain imprisoned in so-called re-education camps.”






[16](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt16). Compare, in contrast, the behavior of the U.S. and Britain in detaining hundreds of thousands of German POWs in “reeducation camps” where they could be used for forced labor for up to three years after World War II, or the execution of hundreds of Japanese and massive purges in Japan and Germany, regarded as proof of Western humanitarianism. (See above, chapter 2, section 2.)






[17](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt17). See, among many other examples, Fox Butterfield, “Shortages, Misrule and Corruption Said to Plague Vietnam’s Economy,” New York Times (9 June 1978), (reporting, inter alia, a 10 to 12% rise in industrial production in each of the past two years; but this was “from a very low base, largely reflecting recovery from war damage rather than new growth,” analysts in Hong Kong believe); Peter Hazelhurst, “Old-style corruption begins to taint new regime in Saigon,” London Times (24 April 1978), describing how the daughter of “a wealthy Chinese jeweller” was able to purchase travel documents to escape through bribery, and the problems that face the formerly wealthy as the black market is suppressed.






[18](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt18). The United States is unlikely to attend to these lessons, for obvious reasons, but people who live in its neo-colonial domains may come to heed them, realizing the longstanding fears of U.S. planners with regard to the “ideological successes” of Communist regimes, the rational version of the “domino theory.” See chapter 1, section 2, and the references cited there. It is interesting to compare the situation in the Caribbean. See, for example, Mike Phillips, “Cuba’s shifting image lends a new model to the Caribbean,” New Statesman, 18 April 1978. While in the West, Phillips comments, “Cuba is most often seen as a tool of Soviet policy and, as such, fatally discredited within its own sphere of influence,” in fact, “the reverse is very nearly true” and there is “a renewed pro-Fidel groundswell among Latin American nationalists,” not because of Castroite propaganda but rather because the effect of U.S. policies in Latin America is all too obvious to their victims while “Cuba now offers the Caribbean the choice between attempting to transform its own economies and continuing to accept the model of dependency,” with its “torture, poverty, the suppression of human rights, financial bankruptcy or the overall dependence (in most of the smaller countries) on the whims and necessities of foreign capital.” One can see the logic in the intensive but failed efforts of the United States to subvert Cuban social and economic development by poisoning food supplies, trying to assassinate Castro, terrorist attacks, etc. (See Volume I, chapter 2, note 94.)






[19](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt19). New York Times (9 April 1978). The situation seems still worse in other nearby U.S. colonies, where Filipino workers have been murdered “under mysterious circumstances.” Few of the Filipino and Korean workers have been willing to report abuses for fear of deportation, since even under these conditions (“like slavery”) they “can usually make more in an hour than they could for a full day’s work, say, in Manila,” where workers benefit from the fruits of a U.S. humanitarian effort that began 80 years ago. Cf. Volume I, chapter 4, section 3. An ACLU observer on Guam states that immigration officers and the code they apply have given contractors and their agents “virtually total power over their workers, a licence to steal and beat the men without restraint,” while female immigrants, according to the labor department official cited, “have been forced to have sexual relations with immigration officers to keep from being deported.”











This report, a rare example of serious journalism, aroused no comment and quickly passed from memory.

[22](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt22). See also Patrice de Beer, Le Monde (26-28 January 1976), translated in the Manchester Guardian Weekly (11 July 1976): “It is realized in Saigon today that Operation Phoenix, conducted by the Americans, which involved the elimination of Communist Party officials, together with the bombings had been fearfully effective. The number of revolutionary cadres is said to have dropped from the 80,000 or so before the United States intervened to a maximum of 50,000 in 1975, most of them soldiers. Party cells were successively wiped out in the rural districts and decimated in the cities. At the beginning of the new regime, there were 5,000 militants in Saigon, of whom 2,000 were cadres, not necessarily the best, but those who had managed to survive Nguyen Van Thieu’s repression machine. ‘In the last few years of the war,’ Nguyen Huu Tho, the president of the Front, told me, ‘our activities declined because our comrades had been eliminated...The best of us were sacrificed, and we did not have enough cadres to run the cities after the liberation. We had to take people who had revolutionary fervour, but no experience, and to bring personnel down from the North.’” (See chapter 1, section 2, and Volume I, chapter 5, section 1.5.)

[27](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt27). Cf. Martin Woollacott, “Vietnam: still two nations,’’ Manchester Guardian Weekly (25 April 1976). He writes that “South Vietnam now has, for the first time, something like a true health service.” He cites a Catholic sister who had worked in the Central Highlands for 20 years and “described with admiration how within weeks of taking over, the Communists had established clinics in every village and new 50-bed hospitals in the towns. People who previously had no chance of hospital treatment at all were now getting it.” See note 97. See also the report of the study mission to Vietnam by Senator Edward Kennedy for comment on achievements of the health program and the enormous problems caused by lack of supplies and the legacy of the war. Congressional Record, S 14007f., 22 August 1978. Also, Hearing before the Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Ninety-Fifth Congress, second session, 22 August 1978, in which members of the study mission testified, reporting determined and in some cases encouraging efforts to meet health and nutrition problems despite deplorable conditions. Mildred Kaufman summarized what appears to be their general impression: “I was very impressed with the rather stark conditions under which the people of Vietnam are valiantly struggling to overcome the aftermath of the war” (p. 25).











Health care developments under the extremely onerous conditions of Indochina are especially interesting for the contrast with conditions under subfascism. We have discussed in Volume I the absolute decline of public health expenditures under the auspices of the Brazilian generals, and the similar disregard for the health conditions of the majority in the Philippines, Indonesia and elsewhere in the subfascist empire. We are awaiting a Butterfield-Kamm study comparing medical care in the countryside of Indochina with that in, say, Indonesia or South Vietnam under U.S. rule, taking into account both the facts and the resources available.

Time the same day quotes Secretary of Defense Harold Brown who explains that “a lesson we learned in Vietnam is that we should be very cautious about intervening in any place where there is a poor political base for our presence.” Time (23 May 1977). If there is a good political base, as the Russians claim to have found in Czechoslovakia in 1968, then the use of massive U.S. force to destroy “local Communist subversion or rebellion that does not constitute armed attack” in violation of the supreme law of the land is, presumably, quite appropriate. (Cf. chapter1, note 16).

[32](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt32). Butterfield follows standard Western practice in identifying southerners who hold key decision-making positions in the Hanoi regime as “northerners.” That Vietnamese adhere to these imperialist conventions is perhaps open to question.






[33](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt33). See the reports of Snepp, Casella, de Beer, and Dudman cited above. “One possible factor behind the continued dominance of Northerners in the reunified Vietnam,” Butterfield speculates, “is that the old ethnic prejudices between Northerners and Southerners have persisted.” Another possible factor is that the United States decimated what it always recognized to be the only mass-based political force in the South, but this factor is not fit to print.






[34](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt34). See also the AFP report carried by the New York Times (16 March 1978) on a road trip from Hanoi to Saigon which reveals “a startling new look to this country a little less than three years after the end of hostilities”—new construction, rice fields and coffee plantations, and homes that “have sprung up in areas that two years ago still resembled lunar landscapes,” in areas that were “like a desert because of the bombing.” The report continues: “Provincial authorities in the south reported large surpluses of rice but did not explain why the surplus had not been sent north.” No speculation on the reasons is offered.






[35](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt35). A personal experience may be relevant. After a few days in Vientiane, one of us (Chomsky) was brought into contact with underground Pathet Lao cadres and sympathizers in the city, including a teacher in a Buddhist school (who was, shortly after, picked up by CIA agents), a guerrilla from northern Laos, and a minister in the U.S.-backed government who was hoping for a Pathet Lao victory. Cf. At War With Asia, chapter 4, where identities were concealed in the midst of the ongoing U.S. war. The attitudes of such people could barely have been known to readers of the Free Press, which also virtually ignored the hundreds of thousands of rural and urban poor, who are rarely considered when assessments of attitudes are given by Butterfield and others.

Even a Vietnamese nun visiting Canada was apparently denied entry into the United States. See Don Luce’s Congressional testimony in the Hearings to which we return (see note 70).

As we will see in chapter 6, Kamm adopts a similar pretense in the case of Cambodia. In the case of East Timor, however, Indonesian officials are the principal source of information for the Times correspondent. See Volume I, chapter 3, section 4.4.

It should be added that Vietnam was “irremediably miserable” not because of God’s wrath, but as a direct result of the vicious practices of French colonialists, documented in painstaking detail by Ngo Vinh Long, Peasant Revolutionary Struggles in Vietnam in the 1930s, Harvard University Ph.D. Dissertation, May, 1978; see also his Before the Revolution: the Vietnamese Peasants Under the French, MIT Press, 1973, which includes a revealing account of these years as seen by peasants themselves. The revolutionary struggles of the 1930s, as Long fully documents, were part of an impressive struggle for independence and democratic control of social life, intensified by the miserable conditions resulting from French rule which led to mass deaths from starvation in the 1930s, while the French (working in part through their local allies among landlords and village officials) compelled the starving peasants to purchase alcohol from their monopoly, withheld aid, prevented the rebuilding of dikes and wantonly murdered those who stood in their way. Now, Western reporters bewail the fact that Indochinese revolutionaries who studied in Paris failed to absorb the traditional “humanism” of Western civilization. See Martin Woollacott, Boston Globe (2 October 1977) excerpted from the Manchester Guardian.

[43](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt43). Like drug addiction, venereal disease was virtually unknown prior to the U.S. invasion. See Don Luce’s congressional testimony to which we return. We may note, in this connection, some recent concern in the United States over the fact that many war veterans appear to be developing symptoms associated with excessive use of defoliants. See, for example, Boston Globe (25 March, 8 October 1978); New York Daily News (11 June 1978). Notably missing from these reports is any concern for the possible effects on the Vietnamese, who were surely subject to far heavier doses, or for U.S. responsibility to offer them some medical assistance. On this matter see the comments by Arthur Galston, a plant physiologist at Yale University, in the private hearings cited in note 56. In the Far Eastern Economic Review, 11 August 1978, Tom Grundfeld reports Galston’s conclusions on his return from the most recent of his many trips to Vietnam. Apart from the ecological damage caused by bombing and chemical warfare, what particularly concerned him was the extensive use of herbicides containing dioxin, which causes cancer. “Galston said that liver cancer is now the second most common cause of death in Vietnam, where before the war it was rare.”






[44](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt44). Recall again the interesting list of the sole violators of human rights that deserve such punishment by the U.S. guardians of global morality: Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Cuba, Mozambique, Angola—and Uganda, thrown in for good measure, and something of a joke, since the United States is “Uganda’s largest free world trading partner, buying one third of its coffee exports in 1977 (price tag: $245 million) and thereby providing the hard currency essential to keeping Amin’s repressive regime in power.” Senator Lowell Weicker, “Stop subsidizing Amin’s murders,” Christian Science Monitor (21 August 1978). Coffee sales amount to over 85% of the government’s revenues, according to Weicker. Among the other current contributors to Idi Amin are “a mysterious Israeli tycoon and the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence service,” who “appear to have provided Idi Amin’s Uganda Airlines with its two Boeing 707 jetliners as part of an Israeli effort to spy on Libya,” an absurdity, since it is well known to the Libyans so that “nobody is fooling anybody in this affair,” though “Idi Amin must be delighted with a cut-rate service that transports Ugandan coffee, officials and their mistresses to Europe and brings back whiskey, machine tools, livestock, and Mercedes Benz limousines.” “But the big winner in this operation appears to be Shaul Eisenberg, the elusive Israeli entrepreneur at its center.” Eisenberg works in close collaboration with the Israeli Aircraft Industry, a subsidiary of the Israeli Defense Department; his trading firm is also supported by “the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which is supposed to make loans to promote American exports.” He is also “the sole beneficiary of what in Israel is called ‘the Eisenberg law’ [which] exempts from tax certain companies that do business abroad. So far, it fits only Eisenberg.” “Ugandan Plane Deal Believed Key to Israeli Spy Operation,” Washington Post, London (11 September 1978). Presumably the author is Bernard Nossiter; see his “How the CIA keeps Idi Amin in whiskey,” New Statesman, (13 October 1978), virtually the same article, but with the additional information on CIA involvement, or perhaps coordination.

[47](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt47). The cynical exploitation of the MIA issue by the United States merits little comment. Reporting on Carter’s Commission to Hanoi to inquire into the MIA matter, the Washington Post sermonized that “it is ghoulish for the Vietnamese to trade on heartbreak,” but we must understand that “‘the losses they themselves suffered—losses that they define as an American responsibility—left them with little else to trade” (how odd that they should define these losses as “an American responsibility”). But they can expect no more than “token direct assistance from Washington,” given their human rights record, the Post explains. (“Vietnam Mission,” Washington Post, 23 March 1971). Nayan Chanda (“Laying the MIA issue to rest,” Far Eastern Economic Review, 11 March 1977) reports the same story in a slightly different way. The report of the U.S. Select Committee on the Missing Persons in Southeast Asia, he writes, “clearly shows how Hanoi has been pressed to supply information about people lost in non-hostile circumstances, on the open sea and unknown to the Vietnamese authorities.” The existence of such cases “erodes the credibility of the United States’ data base...it may appear to the Indochinese leaders that the United States has deliberately requested information which they cannot furnish in order to embarrass them or to prevent meaningful talks” (quoted from the Committee reports).

A Catholic and cousin of the Archbishop of Saigon, he was editor of Tin Sang until it was banned by Thieu and then escaped to Europe. He is now once again editing Tin Sang. Ho Ngoc Nhuan was a member of the Saigon Assembly. Ly Chanh Trung is a well-known Catholic intellectual.

He prints articles critical of the government and publishes translations of foreign affairs analyses from Le Monde of Paris, the New York Times and the Washington Post. The Thieu regime cut off his newsprint, confiscated his property and sentenced him to prison for doing that sort of thing.” He claims that there is no censorship, but adds: “I am a self-censor—I know what we should publish in the interests of the country and the Vietnamese people.” Such self-censorship can be equivalent to censorship, or worse (if accompanied by the delusion of freedom), as readers of the Free Press should be aware.

[67](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt67). Catholic missionaries have long been notorious for their role in colonial oppression. For example, during the peasant uprisings in 1930-1931 French priests led “pacification” teams. Others usurped communal land and brought soldiers to intimidate and kill resisting peasants. The heavily censored Saigon press in 1938 reported that the manager of an estate of a French Catholic priest closed canals that were the communication routes for peasants in the area and forced them to pay tolls or hand over possessions, resorting to savage beatings if they refused, with no action by the French authorities despite much publicity. Long, Peasant Revolutionary Struggle (pp. 50, 212, 225).











The dubious role of the Catholic Church during the war has been discussed in the National Catholic Reporter, a leading church weekly, after a year-long investigation of the Catholic Relief Services by its Washington correspondent, Richard Rashke. Rashke alleges that “during much of the Vietnam War, Catholic Relief Services abandoned its apolitical humanitarian role and became an adjunct of the American military effort,” turning over “vast quantities of relief supplies...to both U.S. and South Vietnamese military units to be used as pay for irregular forces and incentives for intelligence gathering” and allowing U.S. military personnel to work in relief offices where they had access to “information valuable to military intelligence but possible disastrous to the Vietnamese civilians whom the organization was chartered to help.” The report charges that 90% of the church relief agency’s budget came from the US AID program “on a quid pro quo basis, which presupposed the church agency would reciprocate ‘by accepting U.S. policy without criticism and by sharing information with US AID personnel.’” US AID was admittedly a CIA cover in Laos from 1962, and perhaps elsewhere as well. Catholic Relief Services also supplied rations for interrogation centers and political prisons, including the Con Son prison with its “tiger cages.” It was incorporated into the U.S. refugee program which forced “Vietnamese civilians from homes and farms into refugee camps, which were supplied by the organization.” After earlier criticisms in this regard, the organization “merely changed the accounting procedures,” Rashke alleges. Quotes from Marjorie Hyer, Washington Post (13 December 1976). See also Kenneth A. Briggs, New York Times (14 December 1976).











Western visitors to Indochina (including one of us) have observed the cruel and inhuman attitude of some Catholic missionaries towards the population, which has a long history. It is remarkable that the testimony of Catholic missionaries condemning alleged practices of Indochinese revolutionaries is so commonly accepted without question in the West.











On the role of missionaries in Vietnam and elsewhere, see the interview with Doug Hostetter, “An Insider’s Story: Religious Agencies in Viet-Nam,” in NACLA’s Latin America and Empire Report, December 1973: Christian Mission for the Empire; Rev. Richard Edwards, “The CIA and Christian Mission: Can We Get the CIA Out of the Church,” Signs of the Times, Winter, 1978. Both articles review evidence of what Hostetter calls the “nice hand-in-glove relationship between the Christian clergy and the U.S. military” and the CIA. Cf. also Volume I, chapter 3, section 4.3.






[68](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt68). The Catholic Church seems to be taking the same stand. At the Synod of Bishops in Rome, October, 1977, the Archbishop of Saigon who attended and then travelled in Europe along with Cardinal Trin Nhu-Kue of Hanoi, discussed the problems faced by the church in operating in a “marxist milieu”: “Instead of theoretical discussions, the communists want only concrete facts. The christians therefore have to show a new countenance, the authentic countenance of Christ and the Church.” Accordingly, “In July, 1976 at the Episcopal Conference of the two ecclesiastical provinces of Hue and Saigon we bishops unanimously and without ambiguity launched an appeal to all the Catholics, inviting them to take the way of commitment, i.e., contribute to the construction of society.” The Pope, in response, urged Catholic relief organizations to offer assistance to Vietnam and encouraged Catholics in Vietnam to take part with all their strength in “the great work of reconstruction” (L’Osservatore Romano, 9 December 1977); distributed along with the statement of the Archbishop by Fraternité Vietnam—see note 51, this chapter).











See Henry Tanner, “Saigon Archbishop Says Coexistence with Reds is Vital,” New York Times (10 October 1977). On the “reconciliation between the anti-communist Roman Catholic Church of the south and the unified communist government,” see Nayan Chanda, “Clergy and comrades link arms,” Far Eastern Economic Review, 8 October 1976. Chanda discusses the goodwill shown by the government towards the church after the dismantling of a counterrevolutionary group discovered with arms and equipment for counterfeiting currency in a southern church; see Chanda, Far Eastern Economic Review, 27 February 1976 and Turley (see note 72, this chapter). Chanda also cites a letter from the Saigon Archbishop to a Paris Catholic newspaper in which he explains the cooperation of the church with the Communists on grounds that religious freedom “has really been respected” including liturgical ceremonies and conversions to Catholicism.

A few of the many hints that the press might have followed up had it chosen to do so, apart from those already cited: Bill and Peggy Herod, “Vietnam Observations from Hong Kong,” The Disciple, 17 April 1977; H. Lamar Gibble of the Board of World Ministry, “Report on consultations with religious leaders in Vietnam,” 4-11 May 1977; Rev. George W. Webber, Chairperson of Clergy and Laity Concerned, letter, Washington Post, 12 January 1977; representatives of the AFSC and church groups who lived in or visited Vietnam after liberation, who testified in Congressional Hearings: Hearings before the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Committee on International Relations, House of Representatives, Ninety-Fifth Congress, First Session, June 16, 21 and July 26, 1977 (among them Don Luce, who had lived and worked in Vietnam for many years as head of International Voluntary Services and as a journalist, is fluent in Vietnamese, and met privately with “at least 50 former friends,” generally Third Force people, including friends who had returned from reeducation centers); and many others.






[71](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt71). The group is small for many reasons, one of them being the inability of many young scholars who depart from mainstream ideology to obtain employment, a matter that amply merits a careful study; there are many examples that illustrate a minor academic purge.

[73](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt73). The term “ironic” seems out of place, in the light of the systematic policies of the United States throughout its far-flung subfascist domains.






[74](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt74). We have found no record of this. As far as we can determine, Hoan was a minor member of a neutralist Buddhist group. Don Luce, who was well-acquainted with Third Force leaders, testified in the Hearings that he did not know Hoan “as an outspoken antigovernment figure there.” Whatever his role may have been, he never achieved the prominence of such non-Communist dissidents as Ngo Ba Thanh, Ngo Cong Duc, Ly Chanh Trung, Father Chan Tin, Huynh Tan Mam, or others now reported to be active in southern Vietnam, whose reports are ignored.






[75](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt75). In his testimony before the same committee, Nguyen Van Coi of the militantly anti-Communist Hoa Hao Buddhist sect estimates the number of prisoners at one million. Actually his testimony is in some respects more convincing than that of Hoan, since he recounts numerous personal incidents of torture and abuse during almost a year in detention centers and forced labor camps before his escape in October 1976, whereas Hoan offers almost no direct testimony.











The official government position is that there are about 50,000 people imprisoned “for security reasons.” International Herald Tribune, 5 February 1977. Reports on the character of “reeducation camps” vary widely. Compare the testimony of Coi with the observations of McCleary and Meinertz in the Congressional Hearings (see note 70, this chapter), and the subsequent remarks of Luce (115) on conversations with people released from camps. (See also Chanda, p. 68, and similar reporting in Lacouture, op. cit. and elsewhere.) In the private hearings cited above (note 56), Luce quotes the report of one American, Jay Scarborough, who spent five months in a camp and described the treatment as humane. Actually, there is no direct inconsistency among these radically conflicting reports; it is possible that the camps vary widely in character.











The Lacoutures conclude that the camps “are evidently not Gulag—not l’école des Roches [a finishing school] either.” Richard Dudman, who describes a visit to one camp, reports the view of several Western diplomats in Hanoi that the reeducation program seems “to have been an effective trade-off that avoided any possibility of the bloodbath” that had long been predicted after a bitter civil struggle. “Several individual non-Communist Vietnamese who could be questioned privately said that they had been amazed at the leniency of the victorious Communists.” St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “Vietnam’s Dismal New Camps,” (3 November 1977). See also, Casella, op. cit.






[76](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt76). This was offered in response to a question by Rep. Smeeton about the “50,000 to 500,000 people...killed during the ‘refashioning’ of the North’s agriculture and economy” in the 1950s. In an earlier session, Turley had testified on these exaggerated propaganda claims, offering the estimate of probably 5,000 killed on the basis of Moise’s careful study. Cf. Volume I, chapter 5, section 2.2. As is so often true, mere fact is never allowed to get in the way of useful propaganda concerning the enemy.






[77](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt77). In Africa, the Middle East, and Taiwan, Hoan said, referring to unidentified press reports.






[78](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt78). See the eyewitness reports of Ediger, Klassen, Tran and many others. In the same Congressional Hearings Don Luce reported that he had seen religious materials published in South Vietnam and had attended churches in Hanoi and Saigon that were functioning with parishioners. He also recalled that the Archbishop of Hanoi was recently made a Cardinal by the Vatican, and stated that the former teachers continue to teach in Catholic Schools. Paul F. Mcleary, Executive Director of the World Church Service Delegation, testified that he “went unexpectedly to a 6 a.m. mass at a Roman Catholic Church. It was filled.” The Archbishop said that “there were over 100 studying in a major seminary to go into the priesthood, that they were not decreasing in terms of the size of the church, but he felt they were now growing....At this point, the leadership of the Buddhist community, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Protestant Church...seem supportive of the present political situation, the present government, and did not give indications that these kinds of pressures existed upon them, or that there were restraints on their activities.” In the 22 August 1978 Hearings (see note 27, this chapter) Archbishop Philip M. Hannan described his attendance at a crowded mass. (See notes, 52, 68, 70, 83, this chapter.)

[83](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt83). Several examples have been mentioned and we return to others. One further well-known example is Richard Hughes, who continued his work with orphans while living with the Vietnamese until he left in August, 1976. Even during the war, American visitors to Vietnam were free to speak privately to Vietnamese whom they met through professional and other contacts and the absence of overt security was remarkable under the circumstances, as we know from direct experience and the testimony of friends. For example, one of us (Chomsky) spent many hours with professional colleagues in Hanoi and walked unaccompanied through both urban and remote village areas. Hoan’s claim requires us to believe that policies have radically changed in the postwar period, despite substantial testimony to the contrary. We have heard privately from reputable journalists who have visited Vietnam that friends from earlier years seemed afraid to talk to them, but that is considerably short of Hoan’s blanket claim. Others do not report anything of the sort. For example, John Fraser of the Toronto Globe and Mail reports that he spent two weeks “in and around Ho Chi Minh city,” left to his own devices insofar as he chose. He “covered nearly all the districts of the city, by day and night, and talked to a great number of people.” He found “the willingness of so many people to talk openly about their frustrations and complaints...exhilarating—a journalist’s gold mine,” though ultimately this openness was “oppressive” since he “had no help or remedies to offer” to their discontents. His testimony too is radically inconsistent with Hoan’s claims.











As for the “discontent” so openly voiced in Saigon, Fraser found that “the complaints were rarely what we in the West would describe as human rights problems” but rather “huge gripes about the declining standard of living,” that is, the decline in the “subsidized and materialistic standard of living [that] had been provided for this city” (or at least those elements of the city with whom journalists were familiar). Like other commentators concerned with fact, he too points out that the Communists have gone out of their way to maintain the artificial economy of Saigon, despite the grinding poverty elsewhere: “For all the talk of revenge, people in Saigon eat better, dress better, work less and have more trinkets to play with than the people of Hanoi, whose poverty remains real and painfully obvious.” Fraser was particularly struck by the Saigon “cowboys,” “some of the toughest young people I have ever encountered,” the gangster element created by the U.S. invaders who now refuse to work and constitute a continuing social problem. Fraser found the new Saigon/Ho Chi Minh city to be neither at the extreme of “a city groaning under oppression” nor a city with “a new dignity,” though it had “aspects of both.” Reprinted in the Christian Science Monitor (5 December 1978), from the Toronto Globe and Mail (25 November 1978). This is part 2 of a seven-part series (24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 November and 1 December). In other sections, he describes the horrendous problems facing this “blighted land” of “grinding poverty” in the North and a “declining standard of living” for those in the South who have to “come to terms with the reality of Vietnam’s over-all poverty.” The problems include the legacy of the war, open warfare along the Cambodian border and a dangerous confrontation with China, catastrophic flooding and “the prospect of famine,” and “an almost complete lack of foreign funds to pay for its modest plans in modernization.” The ethnic Chinese, he believes, are not persecuted in the North, “while in the South, the actual persecution of ethnic Chinese is based exclusively on class and economic divisions.” But the problem was handled quite clumsily, he believes. In contrast, “the Catholic question is being managed with considerable sophistication and finesse” in the South, and he gives a interesting account of Church-State accommodation and conflict. He also relates conversations with Mme. Ngo Ba Thanh and Father Huynh Cong Minh, “also a member of the National Assembly as well as the editor of a national Catholic newspaper,” both non-Communists who struck him “as deeply troubled and sincere people struggling to come to terms with present-day reality in Vietnam,” basically supportive of the regime and its policies.

Bishop Thuan is in fact held under police custody in Hanoi, according to a letter from Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) that was “slipped out” to the Vatican “under the noses of Communist officials.” Thuan is a nephew of former President Diem and “an outspoken anti-Communist.” Archbishop Binh wrote that he had met with Thuan just before his trip to Rome (see note 68). He wrote that Thuan is “in good health, although a little thinner, and alert in his mind” and quoted him as saying that he was well-treated: “I am quite well today, so please, when you go to Rome, explain to the Pope and to the archbishop who is in charge of preaching and to others what is the truth in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. I say these things, not because of the presence of this cadre in Hanoi but because it is the truth.” Richard Dudman, St. Louis Post-Dispatch (7 November 1977). Dudman was informed of the letter by Father Chan Tin in Ho Chi Minh City.

For supplementary information, see Chomsky and Herman, “Saigon’s corruption crisis.” Whatever one may think of the arrest of Thanh after the Vinh Son affair, Jacqueney’s characterization of him gives some insight into his own standards of evaluation.











Another person alleged by Jacqueney to be a prisoner is Tran Ngoc Chau, who was arrested by the Thieu regime and imprisoned in 1969. Chau had been Program Director of Revolutionary Development, a pacification program designed to gather intelligence on the NLF infrastructure, and in his trial claimed to be a supporter of Thieu and Nixon (see Indochina Resource Center report, cited above). Jacqueney does not report the fact that Chau was framed with the collaboration of William Colby, CIA Station Chief Theodore Shackley and Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, and that the CIA in Washington refused to evacuate him from Vietnam (Snepp, op. cit., p. 15; recall Casella’s observation, p. 84 above). Richard Dudman reported from Vietnam that “A well-informed Vietnamese said that Chau had been under house arrest until early October but now was free” (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 3 November 1977).






[93](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt93). The reason cannot have been that U.S. journals do not review French books or that Lacouture is unknown. For example, Father François Ponchaud’s highly critical account of postwar Cambodia became an instant media hit when it was reviewed in the New York Review by Jean Lacouture, with considerable embellishment, only a few weeks after its publication in Paris. We return to this book and its reception in the West in chapter 6.






[94](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt94). According to the New York Review, he arrived in Vietnam “in December 1948 and stayed on for twenty-eight years.” He himself says that he arrived in Vietnam in 1957 and “starting in 1963, and for 13 years without interruption, I was on the staff of the Alexander-de-Rhodes Student Center...(Congressional Hearings, June-July, 1977, p. 81). Later he claims to “have lived with the people for 19 years” (p. 22). The Globe and Mail introduces him as having spent 19 years in Vietnam. The issue is not particularly important in itself, but gains some interest in the context of the more general question of the credibility of Gelinas’s report and the media treatment of it.











According to a detailed curriculum vitae provided by Father Tran Tam Tinh of Fraternité Vietnam in a letter of 15 March 1977, Gelinas spent the years 1958-59 and 1965-76 in Saigon. In 1957 and 1964 he was in Taiwan and from 1960-63 at Columbia University in New York. Basically the same account appears in Seven Days, 9 May 1977 in an article by Jon Steinberg.

[97](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt97). To our knowledge, no visitor or resident in Vietnam apart from Gelinas has reported mass suicides in September-October, 1975 following the currency regulations. Ms. Forsythe, however, has some other things to say based on her three years in South Vietnam, including 6 months after the war when “I was free to travel anywhere in the city, and did so...by public bus or on foot...[which]...gave me ample chance to meet ordinary people and observe the impact of the new government on the daily lives of people.” She reports having seen children suffering from severe malnutrition under the U.S.-Thieu regime, eating only leaves, apparently because the Saigon armed forces were hoarding rice purchased by the United States for distribution to the needy, and children killed or wounded by ARVN soldiers for revenge or “target practice.” She also describes the many false rumors that circulated during and after the war about Viet Cong atrocities, discussions with neighbors who returned to ordinary lives after “study and practice” (i.e., “reeducation”), the impressive spirit of students who were engaged in social and economic reconstruction, and the substantial improvement in health care for the poor people who “are benefactors of any aid that is flowing into that country” which, for the first time, has honest officials. She denies most of what Gelinas reports, saying “It is very hard for me in listening to Father Gelinas to square what he says with my own experience,” the standard reaction, as we shall see. Her report, as distinct from that of Gelinas, did not exactly become an international media sensation.

Compare the report by Father Gianni (cf. note 69), who left Vietnam at the same time as Gelinas. “I remember the day on which many of us were invited to a meeting with the civil authorities. They thanked all of us foreign religious for the many years missionaries from abroad had been working in Vietnam. But since they claimed that the number of native Vietnamese priests, sisters and religious was sufficient, we were no longer needed, and so they invited us to return to our own native countries...Here, as in many other cases, when the socialist government of Vietnam invited foreign missionaries to leave, this brought into focus a situation in need of correction for many years in Vietnam.”

[105](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt105). Don Braid, “Viets ‘pray for war,’” Montreal Star (26 March 1977). Excerpts of the L’Express-New York Review interview are reprinted, and the journal notes that this “highly unflattering report...has appeared in mass-circulation newspapers and magazines in France, Italy, England and the United States.” Here Gelinas is said to have “lived in Vietnam for 15 years” (see note 94), and he has become the “director of the Alexander of Rhodes Education Center.”






[106](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt106). Martin, who remained in Vietnam after the war ended, is the author of Reaching the Other Side; cf. note 10, this chapter. Many of the same charges by Gelinas are refuted, on the basis of direct eyewitness observation, by Forsythe, Hughes, and the Canadian Vietnamese visitors; for example, his claims about a “coup d’état against the PRG” on July 19-20, 1975, when “the city woke up in a state of siege,” and the PRG headquarters “was surrounded by armored cars” (he expands on this “coup” in his congressional testimony). During this “coup,” Martin reports, “friends and I rode bicycles freely around town” observing nothing except somewhat enhanced security arrangements in expectation of demonstrations and violence that did not eventuate; he also points out that Gelinas mislocated the PRG headquarters. Forsythe also reports that while there was street gossip about a possible “coup,” it “never took place” and “there was no unrest” and “never a purging of the PRG from any level in Saigon” to her knowledge. Hughes adds that not only was there no “coup d’état against the PRG,” but in fact any such coup “would have resoundingly failed because, among other things,” the place mentioned by Gelinas is “not where their ‘headquarters’ was” (they actually had no headquarters, he adds, but rather leadership was “decentralized into a plethora of almost autonomous ‘offices’ (themselves broken down into smaller teams), functions, and locations.” Hughes also comments on the absurdity of the belief that tanks and infantry could have rounded up “a widely scattered, guerrilla leadership who, for years, had resisted one of the world’s most sophisticated war machines.” The remainder of Gelinas’s charges suffer a like fate, according to eyewitnesses who were not, like Gelinas, living behind what Hughes calls “the barred entrance of the walled-off Western style Alexandre-de-Rhodes center.”






[107](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt107). Recall that this claim is expressly denied by numerous independent observers, cited above. It is worth noting, perhaps, Gelinas’s statement that “the churches have never been fuller,” contradicting the claims of the other media favorite, Nguyen Cong Hoan; but this is because “many Vietnamese find solace in prayer.” The contradictions on this score between Gelinas and Hoan have not troubled the journalists and editors who cite them both as giving the true picture of life in Vietnam, an interesting example of the ability of the faithful to tolerate counterevidence. According to Hughes, Gelinas told him: “people were ordered to have a good Christmas [in December, 1975], to have religious services.” There was no written order, he added in response to questioning, but local authorities “gave the churches Christmas trees. To show the world, you see.”

[114](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt114). Recall a point that is quite significant in this connection. Gelinas was completely unknown. His various accounts cite no evidence or documentation, and their credibility therefore depends entirely on his credibility, as judged by comments of his that are subject to check. To appreciate properly the Western reaction to Gelinas, consider the following hypothetical case: imagine that Russian forces were driven out of Hungary next year, and that a Russian who had worked for many years in a Russian cultural center in Hungary came forward in the Soviet Union, deploring the situation in Hungary after liberation without citing any evidence that could be checked, offering reports that are entirely at variance with eyewitness accounts of others during the same period, and describing Hungary under Russian rule as a land of freedom and wealth, now suffering under the yoke of an oppressor. Under such hypothetical circumstances, no one familiar with the Soviet propaganda system would be surprised to discover that his reports receive wide publicity and much acclaim and are used by editorialists as a club to beat Russian dissidents who denounced Russian rule in Hungary, the 1956 invasion, etc. The Western treatment of Gelinas is quite comparable, and once again gives an insight into the workings of the Free Press.






[115](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt115). He is predictably silent on the decimation of southern forces by the United States.






[116](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt116). Gelinas tells us little about his ministrations to his flock during his years in Vietnam. An American visitor to the bookstore he ran remembers him as “the only priest who was a hawk and who seemed more interested in business than in religious matters. Books of the neutralist Third Force were not sold in his store, but he did have a government monopoly on all translations of government books into Western languages.” Jon Steinberg, op. cit. (see note 94). Gelinas’s bitterness towards the government that forced him to leave is understandable, Steinberg adds, while “Those who print his stories as truth have less excuse.”






[117](../Text/Chapter4.html#Chapter4-Txt117). See note 83. Recall that Fraser interviewed non-Communist activists who had defended political prisoners under the Thieu regime and who, contrary to what Paringaux wrote, had not “now become silent” but expressed their support for the general policies of the regime. Fraser’s account also conflicts with the well-publicized French reports in other significant respects. His reaction to their reports appears in part four of his seven-part series, 28 November 1978.

Both CBS and Browning refer to Le Monde as a left-wing newspaper, but otherwise, their reports were generally accurate.











The editorial is about what one would expect in a journal that not long ago was featuring discussions by one of its saner commentators (Joseph Harsch) on the relative merits of bombing trucks and dams (the latter so much more satisfying to the pilots, who come home “with a feeling of accomplishment” when they see the waters “pour through the breach and drown out huge areas of farm land, and villages, in its path” and so much more effective in “hurt[ing] people”).

See Bernard Fall, Anatomy of a Crisis: The Laotian Crisis of 1960-61, Doubleday, 1969, for a detailed exposure of some of the more ludicrous incidents in the early phases of the U.S. war; this exposure, like others, had no detectable effect on subsequent reporting.

See the reports by Henry Kamm in the New York Times, cited below; or for example a Sunday feature story by Ogden Williams, “The Tragic Plight of our Abandoned Allies,” Washington Post (24 September 1978). Williams is identified as a former CIA officer who also worked with USAID in Vietnam—quite possibly, a distinction without a difference in this case, since as was finally conceded in public, the aid program, in Laos at least, was providing a CIA cover from 1962. He claims that the Hmong army organized by the CIA was tying up two divisions of North Vietnamese regulars in Laos. Comparable claims are common, but tend to evaporate on investigation; cf. the references of footnote 4 for detailed analyses. Sources close to the U.S. government estimate perhaps one combat regiment of North Vietnamese soldiers in northern Laos, where the CIA army was fighting, in 1968.

The scholarly literature is useful but must be treated with care, since as demonstrated in the sources just cited the conclusions reached often derive from the most dubious evidence, sometimes sheer fabrication on the part of government officials who are taken quite seriously despite their long record of prevarication.






[5](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt5). See John Everingham, “Press war creates problems for Laos,” Far Eastern Economic Review, writing from Vientiane before his expulsion on the “hostile and inaccurate Thai press coverage of Laotian affairs” that “may convince those not on the spot,” and on the questionable “principle of reporting Laos from Thailand,” where one finds a “stream of anti-Lao hysteria and falsities.”

[8](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt8). Hieberts, op. cit. These features of lovely little Laos, and of other “small old places,” have intrigued thoughtful U.S. observers like Reasoner much less than the eroticism, which, as visitors to Vientiane quickly learned, was a major preoccupation of the press corps, many of whose members seemed to divide their time between the U.S. Embassy (where they received “the news”), the hotel bars, and the local house of prostitution. As elsewhere in Indochina, there were noteworthy exceptions.

[11](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt11). E.g., Phoumi Nosavan’s “proclaimed anti-Communism won him military aid from the Eisenhower administration and the Thai government” in 1960. In fact, Phoumi was armed and backed by the United States in his successful effort to overthrow the government recognized by the United States, and thousands of Thai troops (virtually, U.S. mercenaries) were apparently fighting in Laos (see At War with Asia). The U.S. role in overthrowing the 1958 political settlement in which the Pathet Lao emerged as the dominant force is not so much as mentioned, though it is entirely beyond controversy. See, for example, Hugh Toye, Laos: Buffer State or Battleground, Oxford, 1968; Charles Stevenson, The End of Nowhere: American Policy towards Laos Since 1964, Beacon, 1972.






[12](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt12). See T.D. Allman, New York Times (1 October 1969) reporting on the testimony of refugees from the Plain of Jars and concluding that “the rebel economy and social fabric” are now the main target of the U.S. bombardment, which is claimed to be a success: “The bombing, by creating refugees, deprives the Communists of their chief source of food and transport. The population of the Pathet Lao zone has been declining for several years and the Pathet Lao find it increasingly difficult to fight a ‘people’s war’ with fewer and fewer people.” On the same day Le Monde (weekly selection) reported that this “battering” of Laos had been going on for over five years and that “the United States Air Force carries out more than 12,500 raids a month.” As already noted, eyewitness reports of the U.S. attack on the rebel economy and social fabric had been reported by Jacques Decornoy of Le Monde in July 1968, and repeatedly brought to the attention of editors of the New York Times and other journals, to no effect. See p. 134, above.











See also the eyewitness report by T.D. Allman at just the time when Air Force Secretary Robert Seamans, visiting the same areas, reported that “I have seen no evidence of indiscriminate bombing.” Allman’s report of massive destruction from highly discriminate bombing aimed at civilian targets appeared in the Far Eastern Economic Review and the Manchester Guardian; Seaman’s failure to see anything was reported in the Washington Post. Direct reporting from the ground by Michael Morrow did not appear in the U.S. press at all, to our knowledge, as befits observations of U.S. atrocities by a Western reporter who concludes that “it is unlikely that Americans are or will ever be around to pick up the unexploded pieces of the most extensive bombing campaign in history,” a campaign that is now being expunged from the historical records. See At War with Asia, pp. 95f; For Reasons of State, pp. 173f. For the Decornoy report and much other valuable material that is conveniently ignored in the United States, see N.S. Adams and A.W. McCoy, eds., Laos: War and Revolution, Harper, 1970.






[13](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt13). Given what is known about CIA control and activities, it seems likely that this was part of a U.S. intelligence campaign. This places the subsequent show of compassion for the refugees—see footnote 2—in a still more ugly light.

Southerland was one of the small group of correspondents in Indochina who maintained a high level of professional integrity throughout. We are indebted to Louis and Eryl Kubicka of the AFSC, who spent three years in Laos (including two and one-half years after the war), for additional information about Lyteck and for helpful comments and information about other matters. The Kubickas have made extensive efforts to bring information about postwar Laos to the U.S. press, to little effect. They inform us that their accounts were seriously distorted by New York Times reporters Paul Hoffman and David Andelman, “by the device of omission and by taking the negative side of balanced statements we made” and other standard Free Press techniques. An important analysis of Thai perception of U.S. moves to undermine Thai democracy prior to the October 1976 military coup (see Volume I, chapter 4, section 2) was submitted to the New York Times, Washington Post and other journals, but rejected. For their own account of the postwar situation in Laos, see Louis Kubicka, “Laos: Resettlement Begins on Bombed-Out Plain of Jars—Minus U.S. AID,” Los Angeles Times (1 March 1976); “War Hangover in Laos,” Eastern Horizon, March 1978; “From the Plain of Jars,” Progressive, March 1978.

Interviews with two refugees who returned are reported by John and Beulah Yoder of the Mennonites, writing from Vientiane in February, 1978 in Laos Recovers from America’s War. One, a Hmong tribesman now in a teacher training college, recalls “the intense anti-Lao propaganda in the Thai camps” and the “many lies about Laos” spread in France. In the Thai camp, “we lived like pigs. No one had enough to eat” and the Thai military attempted to recruit refugees to fight communism, possibly in Laos, while camp guards beat or imprisoned anyone trying to escape. The second says that he fled to Thailand “because I didn’t understand the policies or goals of the new regime. In the old regime we were taught only to make ourselves rich. We were not taught love for our nation.” Living in France, he “learned about the goals of the new Lao regime” from the Lao student organization. “He realized they had a vision for Laos which he could share.” On the Thai camps, see footnote 24 below.






[18](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt18). Since these important elements of the “prisoners” in “re-education camps” are a legacy of Western imperialism, they are regularly disregarded in Western commentary.

[22](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt22). See chapter 1, note 16. In the documents cited there, it is proposed that Thailand be developed “as the focal point of U.S. covert and psychological operations in Southeast Asia.” The proposal was implemented, and Thailand also became a major base for direct U.S. military operations against Laos and Vietnam, and for CIA-backed groups attempting to undermine the neutralist government of Cambodia. (See Volume I, chapter 4, section 2; chapter 6, below, and references cited there).

[24](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt24). On the Thai refugee camps, see John Burgess, “City of broken lives,” Far Eastern Economic Review, 26 May 1978. According to refugees, some “use the camp as a base to support the guerrillas harassing the communist government in Laos” though most are more interested in finding another country, usually the United States, to take them in. “People leave Laos for varied reasons: some because they are threatened with reeducation, some because they have records as prostitutes or criminals, others because they cannot find jobs.” The underworld is thriving in the camp, where Thai police “claimed to have discovered a syndicate...that was producing Laotian women for the brothels of Bangkok,” and the drug trade flourishes. 41% of the people in the camp “claimed direct or indirect membership in U.S.-affiliated agencies, mostly the old Laotian armed forces.” A few of the camp’s people intend to join the anti-Communist resistance in Laos, and “one well-placed refugee” reports that small numbers “pass in and out of Laos with help and equipment from the Thai military.” A Hmong veteran of the CIA army reports that “his village had been destroyed by artillery” while others claim that the Lao government used poison gas against them.






[25](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt25). It is superfluous to note that Vietnam’s attempts “to establish normal links with the West” have been blocked at every turn by the U.S. government, since Hanoi has not yet succeeded in meeting the exalted standards set by the United States, to the applause of the Free Press.






[26](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt26). Peter Kovler, “Laos’s need: U.S. rice,” New York Times (14 March 1978). The Op-Ed page of the Times is the spot where all sorts of odd opinions are permitted occasional expression.






[27](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt27). See footnote 6. This is the only press reference to the Hieberts that we have noted, though their eyewitness report from a country virtually closed to the West would have been featured in a country enjoying a free press.






[28](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt28). The reference, presumably, is to the Plain of Jars, where the vast U.S.-inflicted war damage remains unrepaired (if indeed it can be repaired).






[29](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt29). The impending starvation is a result of the U.S. attack and also the natural disasters that have afflicted Southeast Asia in the past several years.






[30](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt30). In what it called “a humanitarian aid decision in keeping with the Administration’s policy of answering basic human needs,” the Carter Administration agreed to send 10,000 tons of rice in August and September of 1978; UPI, “U.S. giving $5m in rice to Laos,” Boston Globe (2 June 1978); Don Oberdorfer, “U.S. Will Give Laos $5 Million in Food Aid To Avert a ‘Disaster,’” Washington Post (1 June 1978). The last U.S. aid was in 1974, when 24,000 tons of rice were sent. The 10,000 tons allegedly forthcoming would supplement the 80,000 tons pledged by other countries. Note that the fear of jeopardizing the canal treaties was past, at this time.











It appears, however, that even this tiny gesture towards “humanitarianism” was a fraud. When the State Department announced that a piddling 10,000 tons of food would be released for the starving Lao on May 31, it was assumed that this munificence would be in addition to the regular contribution of the United States to the World Food Program of the United Nations, which had pledged 30,000 tons of food to Laos. But it seems that the U.S. donation is to be “merely a part of its normal biannual contribution to WFP, and no more.” The estimated need in Laos to avoid disaster is at least 120,000 tons of emergency food. Roger Rumpf and Jacqui Chagnon, AFSC representatives in Laos, letter, Washington Post (14 October 1978). There appear to be no limits to the cynicism of the Human Rights Administration.






[31](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt31). Nayan Chanda, “Laos keeps up a cold front,” Far Eastern Economic Review, 15 April 1977. Vietnamese influence in Laos has no doubt been growing, for several reasons, among them, punitive U.S. policies towards Laos and Vietnam and the Vietnam-China conflict. Occasionally, propaganda fabricated with no concern for fact may be accurate—in this case, in part as a consequence of the brutal policies supported or concealed by the media.

No aid donor countries offered to supply the DDT required for malaria control after the U.S. aid cut-off. Peagam adds that the health problem is exacerbated by efforts to encourage hill tribes to move down to the lowlands in order to conserve the forests and “sending civil servants into the countryside for political seminars and manual work.”






[35](../Text/Chapter5.html#Chapter5-Txt35). Among them, Thai journalists, accurately for once. Theh Chongkhadikij, “Fears of Imminent Famine in Laos,” Bangkok Post (1 March 1977), reporting the fear of “ambassador-level sources in Vientiane” that Laos faces starvation within a few months, largely because of the drought. Similar fears have been repeatedly expressed in the Far Eastern Economic Review.

Recall that the bombing in the Plain of Jars had nothing to do with North Vietnamese supply trails, as loyal correspondents for the New York Times and other specimens of the Free Press continue to pretend.

6 Cambodia






[1](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt1). We would like to thank Stephen Reder, Ben Kiernan, Torben Retbøll, Laura Summers, Serge Thion and Michael Vickery for important information and very helpful comments on an earlier draft of this chapter.











During the period of this review—mid-1975 to the end of 1978—the regime used the name “Democratic Kampuchea.” With some misgivings, we will continue to use the conventional English spelling, “Cambodia,” throughout. Again with misgivings, we will use the term “Khmer Rouge” to refer to the revolutionary movement of Cambodia and to the regime during the period of our review. See Volume I, chapter 1, note 56.






[2](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt2). François Ponchaud, Cambodia: Year Zero, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1978; a revised and updated translation of his Cambodge: année zéro, Julliard, 1977, which became perhaps the most influential unread book in recent political history after a review by Jean Lacouture, to which we return. It is also unusual in that it is the only recent French book on Cambodia to have been not only widely quoted and misquoted, but also translated. In contrast, important French studies of the colonial period and the U.S. intervention have gone unreviewed, unnoticed and untranslated, as was the case with Lacouture’s book on Vietnam, mentioned above: for example, Charles Meyer, Derrière le sourire Khmer, Plon, 1971; Jean-Claude Pomonti and Serge Thion, Des courtisans aux partisans, Gallimard, 1971 (for some discussion of these books, see Chomsky, For Reasons of State, chapter 2). Ponchaud, a French priest who lived in Cambodia for ten years, is the best-informed and most careful of those who have done extensive critical work on postwar Cambodia, though his study is not without serious flaws. For tens of millions of readers in the United States and throughout the world, the major source of information is no doubt John Barron and Anthony Paul, Murder of a Gentle Land: the Untold Story of Communist Genocide in Cambodia, Reader’s Digest Press, Crowell, 1977, expanded from an article in the Reader’s Digest, February 1977. Subsequent references to Ponchaud will be to the U.S. edition cited above, unless explicitly noted. We stress that references are to the U.S., not the British edition, which differs in crucial respects, as we shall see.






[3](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt3). We will return to a few examples. As one indication of the power of the U.S. propaganda system, consider a study of the “Ten Best Censored Stories of 1977” described as “a nationwide media research project” with “a panel often nationally recognized individuals”; one of us (Chomsky) was among them, along with journalist Shana Alexander, Ben Bagdikian of the Graduate School of Journalism at Berkeley, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, Nicholas Johnson (chairman of the ­National Citizens Communications Lobby), Victor Marchetti (former CIA agent who has written important exposés of the intelligence system) and other well-known journalists, writers, and media specialists. The panel selected “Massacre in Cambodia and Vietnam” as one of the ten best censored stories (news release, Office of Public Affairs, Sonoma State College, 9 August 1978). Putting aside any question as to the facts of the matter, this story does not even merit consideration in a study of “censorship,” given the actual media coverage.






[4](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt4). We do not want to imply that this is the only reason why journalists sought out dissenting opinion. In the case of Cambodia, as in the other cases we have discussed, there remains a current of honest journalism though it is often buried under the avalanche of propaganda.

[6](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt6). For example, Morton Kondracke, “How Much Blood Makes a Bloodbath?’ New Republic, 1 October 1977: “Perhaps the United States does bear some responsibility [note the admirable caution], but the doves themselves had better explain why similar things haven’t happened in Vietnam... .” Why is it the responsibility of those who opposed the U.S. intervention that converted a civil struggle into a murderous war to “explain” the consequences that ensued?






[7](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt7). Dissent, Fall 1978. Evidently, the question can be raised only if one accepts two assumptions: 1) the U.S. intervention in Indochina would have prevented a Cambodian bloodbath or was designed for this purpose; 2) the United States has the right to use force and violence to prevent potential crimes—and thus, a fortiori, to resort to force to prevent actual crimes by invading Indonesia, much of Latin America, etc. It is difficult to decide which of the two assumptions that are jointly required for the question even to be raised is the more absurd.

[15](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt15). We choose a factor of a hundred for illustration because of Jean Lacouture’s observation, to which we return, that it is a question of secondary importance whether the number of people killed was in the thousands or hundreds of thousands.






[16](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt16). See note 53, this chapter. Given the wording McGovern used, it is likely that his actual source was a widely quoted allegation by Jean Lacouture that the regime was “systematically massacring, isolating and starving” the population and had “boasted” of having killed some 2 million people. See the reference of note 17. As we shall see, even after Lacouture published a correction, stating that there was no basis for the latter charge, it continues to be reiterated by people who are aware of the correction, along with his more general claim, for which he also provided no evidence that withstands inquiry.






[17](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt17). See his “The bloodiest revolution,” New York Review of Books, 31 March 1977, a review of Ponchaud’s Cambodge: année zéro, translated from Le Nouvel Observateur.

[18](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt18). Ponchaud, op. cit., p. xvi. His estimate of refugees is conservative as compared with some others. We noted earlier a recent estimate of 14,000 Cambodians in Thai refugee camps (others have already been resettled) in addition to an alleged 150,000 who have fled to Vietnam. According to Vietnamese sources, there have been 330,000 refugees and displaced persons from Cambodia since April 1975, including 170,000 of Vietnamese origin, almost all women, children and older people (UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Information Note, Hanoi, 31 July 1978). Based indirectly on this source, the U.S. press has given estimates of 500,000 refugees from Cambodia (Editorial, Boston Globe, 23 August 1978; the record will show that Hanoi sources have rarely been given such credence and publicity; in this case, the journal was unaware of the original source.) On the exodus of Vietnamese refugees from Cambodia, see Laura Summers, “Human Rights in Cambodia,” paper delivered at the International Studies Association, Washington, D.C., February 1978. She estimates that the Vietnamese population of Cambodia was about 450,000 before the war in 1970 and 310,000 were expelled or fled (along with 20,000 detained) during “the racialist campaign against Vietnamese Kampucheans by Lon Nol’s ‘Khmer Republic’” (her source is the well-known demographer Jacques Migozzi, Cambodge: faits et problèmes de population, CNRS, Paris, 1973). See T.D. Allman, cited in Volume I, chapter 3, note 20. Note that this exodus of over 300,000 people during the racialist campaign by the government backed by the United States has been quietly absorbed by the propaganda system, and that Lon Nol is now apparently offered as a serious source for allegations backing a proposal for military intervention in Cambodia. We return to Lon Nol’s earlier exploits.

According to Ponchaud, “the early months were those of blackest terror....The executions continued after the early months of the massive purge of the former regime’s civilian and military cadres and the many recalcitrant elements, but they became less frequent and less summary” (pp. 64, 69). Other sources agree, as we shall see below. Even people who should be ranked among outright propagandists agree that there must have been “some diminution of the killings” (Leo Cherne, MacNeil/Lehrer Report; see note 53). Cherne explains this on the grounds that the population had been reduced from 8 to 5 million, so that there were just fewer people left to kill. On his source for the 5 million figure, see note 118.

[41](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt41). See, for example, Wall Street Journal, editorial (18 July 1978), which offers “Prof. Chomsky’s heroic efforts to disprove the Cambodian bloodbath through textual criticism of witnesses’ statements” as an example of “intellectual levitation” on a par with apologetics for Mao, scholastic debate over the Shaba incursion, or the “passionate” argument of specialists on Africa that “Mau Mau outbreaks in Kenya were a spontaneous response to colonial oppression.” Putting aside these interesting examples, the fact is that apart from letters to journalists who have invented or spread known falsehoods, these “heroic efforts” reduce to the single article cited below (note 100), which notes that refugee reports “must be considered carefully” though “care and caution are necessary” for obvious reasons. No attempt whatsoever was made to “disprove the Cambodian bloodbath.” The article states that “we do not pretend to know where the truth lies amidst these sharply conflicting assessments” cited by experts, of which the more extreme are selected (and distorted) by the press. Furthermore, these perhaps less than heroic efforts contain no specific discussion of witnesses’ statements but rather document falsehoods and misrepresentations by those who have made use of these statements, as well as the continuing efforts by the Wall Street Journal and others to devise apologetics for atrocities within the U.S. sphere. Excerpts from a letter correcting these typical falsehoods appeared in the Wall Street Journal, 7 August.






[42](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt42). See, for example, Norman Peagam, “Good crops and grim terror in Cambodia,” New Statesman, 4 August 1978, or his briefer report in the New York Times (19 July 1978). Peagam makes the important point that “refugees in Thailand and Vietnam give virtually identical accounts,” which he reports graphically—and in this case, credibly.

In the same article, Cherne observes that “there should be no illusion about the consequences” of “an American withdrawal from Vietnam”: “There will be a bloody purge of the non-Communist leaders and intellectuals.”

[48](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt48). As we shall see, the evidence he reported was seriously in error throughout, and the sources on which he relied prove to be quite dubious on further inquiry. Lacouture’s corrections, which were partial and somewhat misleading, were published in the United States when the errors were brought to his attention here, but never in France, where the article originally appeared.






[49](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt49). See chapter 2, section 2. Recall the estimate by the “victim of the liberation,” Pleyber-Grandjean, that the resistance had massacred 7 million people; quite evidently an exaggeration, though with some factual basis in tens of thousands of killings, but at least not widely disseminated as authoritative in the mass media of France and Germany, and not beyond correction.






[50](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt50). This quote from Lacouture appears on the cover of the U.S. version of Ponchaud’s Cambodia: Year Zero.






[51](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt51). To illustrate the issues at stake, consider the following example of a very general phenomenon in the industrial West. A U.S. newspaper in 1978 ran a cartoon showing a picture of a confused Nicaraguan citizen with Somoza on one side and a guerrilla with a gun on the other. The caption defined the alternatives he faced: Somoza’s corruption and oppression on the one hand, “liberation or worse” on the other. It is important in the current phase of the Western system of indoctrination to establish in the popular mind the principle that liberation is a terrible fate for subject peoples, a major reason for the current campaigns of abuse and deceit with regard to Indochina.






[52](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt52). Or, where possible, on independent evidence as to the credibility of those who present reports and interpretations.






[53](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt53). Here are some scattered examples. From the New York Times: (9 July 1975) editorial “scores genocidal policies of Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge rulers,” comparing them to “Soviet extermination of Kulaks or with Gulag Archipelago” and “says silence by US Cong[ress] members and UN must be broken” (quoted from index); (20 October 1975) editorial with similar content; (27 March 1976) editorial contends that Cambodia is a “vast slave labor camp” ruled by “fanatical Communist leaders”; (12 April 1976) article cites Time report that 500,000 Cambodians have perished since April 1975; (3 June 1976) citing a journalist of France Soir: “the figure of a million victims since April 17, 1975, the day of the ‘liberation’ of Phnom Penh, is plausible, if not certain”; David A. Andelman (2 May 1977) “The purges that took hundreds of thousands of lives in the aftermath of the Communist capture of Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975, have apparently ended, for the most part...; (27 July 1977) “Up to 1.2 million people may have been killed under the Communists in Cambodia, a high State Department official said today,” citing Richard Holbrooke, who in fact testified that “Journalists and scholars...guess that between half a million and 1.2 million have died since 1975” (our emphasis, July Hearings, p. 2); C.L. Sulzberger (27 August 1977): “estimates of the number deliberately slaughtered by the Communist regime run from two hundred thousand to one million”; editorial (3 July 1978): “The estimates are that many hundreds of thousands, perhaps even 2 million Cambodians out of a population of 8 million, have been killed or allowed to die of disease and starvation.” Christian Science Monitor: editorial (26 April 1977), “Reports put the loss of life as high as 2 million people out of 7.8 million total”; editorial (31 August 1978) citing State Department officials: “The U.S. government is confident that scores, probably hundreds of thousands of people have been killed.” Washington Post, Don Oberdofer (20 April 1978) citing the former minister of Information of the Lon Nol government: “1 million Cambodians have been ‘slaughtered’ and another million ‘appear to have perished from disease and starvation’”; Jack Anderson (2 May 1978): “Competent sources have offered estimates ranging from 1.8 million to 2.5 million...who...have died from mistreatment and execution”; Jack Anderson (3 May 1978): “The death toll from beatings shootings, starvation and forced labor may have reached 2.5 million victims ...”; Smith Hempstone (7 May 1978): “It appears certain that between 500,000 and 2 million Cambodians...have been executed, starved or worked to death, died of disease or been killed while trying to flee ...” Boston Globe: UPI (17 April 1977): “Most foreign experts on Cambodia and its refugees believe at least 1.2 million persons have been killed or have died as a result of the policies of the Communist regime...Some experts...believe as many as 3.5 million people—half of the total population—have been killed or have died in the past two years;” (12 September 1977): Lon Nol reports that “more than 2.5 million Cambodians have been killed since the Communist Khmer Rouge conquered his country.” Business Week, 23 January 1978: “As many as 2 million may have died out of a population of 5.5 million.” MacNeil/Lehrer Report (TV, 6 June 1978): “In the worst accounts some two million people are said to have been killed by the new Communist regime” (the government specialist Timothy Carney estimated the number of deaths, not by “mass genocide” but by “brutal, rapid change” at “hundreds of thousands”). Many similar examples can be given overseas; to select just two: Die Zeit, (23 April 1976): “500,000 to 1.5 million people have died, been executed or starved”; Izvestia, (9-10 December 1978) alleging 2 million “executions” in Cambodia (Le Monde, 12 December 1978).











We will return to a few other examples of the great many that might be cited from the fall of Phnom Penh to the present.

Note that this analysis, which appeared on the day that Vietnam stepped up its dry season offensive to a full-scale attack with 100,000 troops, appeared well after Vietnamese efforts to establish a Cambodian liberation front, with a program tailored to what are assumed outside of Cambodia to be the needs and concerns of the local population. See Nayan Chanda, “Pol Pot eyes the jungle again,” Far Eastern Economic Review, 15 December 1978. Chanda points out that “None of the 14-member central committee of the KNUFNS [the Vietnamese-established front]...are nationally known figures.” The one well-known Cambodian whom rumor had associated with KNUFNS, So Phim, “who was earlier reported to be leading anti-Pol Pot resistance, is dead.” Chanda, FEER, 26 January 1979. As noted in the preface, the Vietnamese plainly do not believe that the KNUFNS can control the population without an army of occupation that far outnumbered the Pol Pot forces even before the massive Vietnamese assault that is reported to have destroyed a substantial part of the Cambodian army.






[70](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt70). Recall the experience of Russia during World War I, or even World War II, when Hitler succeeded in raising a substantial army in support of the invasion of Russia and, according to some analysts, might have achieved his ends if Nazi atrocities had not helped organize the massive resistance that played the major role in the ultimate allied victory. Or recall even the experience of Western Europe, where Germany had little difficulty in organizing local support after its conquests.

Recall some of Henry Kissinger’s thoughts on the inability of people of the Third World to comprehend “that the real world is external to the observer” because their “cultures...escaped the early impact of Newtonian thinking,” leading to a “difference of philosophical perspective” that is “the deepest problem of the contemporary international order.” For discussion of these and comparable profundities, see Chomsky, “Human Rights” and American Foreign Policy, Spokesman, 1978, chapter 1.






[73](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt73). Lewis M. Simons, “Experts list disease as No. 1 killer in Cambodia today,” Washington Post (24 July 1977). In congressional testimony, Twining questioned Simons’s “source on this reevaluation” while agreeing with the contents of this “otherwise excellent article.” Specifically, “I am convinced that the number of people who have died from disease and malnutrition has been even greater than those executed” (July Hearings, p. 8). On the number killed, he offers the estimate: “Certainly thousands or hundreds of thousands.” Twining blames the government of Cambodia for the deaths from disease, claiming that they rejected drugs and medicines. Ponchaud reports that from August 1976, with the resumption of foreign trade, medicines have been imported, along with U.S.-produced DDT, including antimalaria drugs sent in 1976 from the AFSC (pp. 94-97, 116).

[80](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt80). This is one of the arguments offered by Cambodian authorities for the forced evacuation of the urban centers. The second reason regularly advanced is the fear of CIA-backed subversion by groups left in Phnom Penh (cf. Ponchaud, op. cit., p. 19, citing a statement of September, 1975). These reasons are continually rediscovered by the U.S. press: e.g., New York Times (29 July 1978), reporting that “for the first time” the government alleged that “the revolutionaries considered the city to be full of agents, ammunition dumps and conspiracies to undermine the new regime, and therefore felt total evacuation to be necessary for defense.” The second argument has more force than is commonly alleged. See Snepp, Decent Interval, pp. 339-40, who reports that the evacuation “left American espionage networks throughout the country broken and useless.” As for the first motive, Ponchaud disputes it. We return to his reasons below, 313.

On this matter, Laura Summers comments (op. cit., see note 63): “By all accounts, however, universal conscription for work prevented a postwar famine.” This appeared in December, 1976. Perhaps by now one should write “by all serious accounts,” or at least the vast majority of them. We have already cited Poole and Simons (with Twining’s concurrence). Comparable judgments from sources by no means sympathetic with the regime will be noted below.






[84](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt84). “McGovern the Hawk,” Wall Street Journal (23 August 1978). Note that it is only the end of the Indochina campaign that was “sordid,” and that the Journal feels no need to observe the injunction of silence, after its disgraceful record of subservience to state power and apologetics for barbarism. Note also the suggestion of the editors that it was the critics who took us through the painful contortions of the Vietnam war, not the war managers. The Journal also pretends that the silence of the activists is of their own choice, rather than a case of simple refusal of access by the mass media.






[85](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt85). One of us (Chomsky) was approached by Time in the preparation of this article in a transparent effort to elicit a favorable comment from a “supporter of the Khmer Rouge.” Instead, Time was offered a (very partial) record of fabrications with regard to Cambodia for which Time and other journals are responsible.






[86](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt86). In his review of U.S. wartime journalism, Peter Braestrup comments that “In 1962-66,...Time policy on Vietnam was hawkish, even euphoric” (Big Story Volume I, Westview Press, 1977, p. 45). While this study contains so many errors that little in it can be assumed to be true, in this case Braestrup is correct. See the references of note 22, chapter 2 of this volume. Later, Time policy was no longer euphoric, though it remained hawkish.

[90](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt90). It is worth noting that the northwestern areas were then subject to Thai-supported anti-Communist guerrilla sabotage activities (see Stephen Heder, “Thailand’s Relations with Kampuchea: Negotiation and Confrontation along the Prachinburi-Battambang Border,” mimeographed, Cornell University, December 1977). An internal Amnesty International paper of 14 June 1976 notes that in that region “there are still many aspects of civil war.” During the period 1972-75 parts of this region were under Thai military domination in part sanctioned by agreements with the Lon Nol government, and there were also instances of land grabbing. The Thai had also annexed and plundered the region in collaboration with Japanese fascism in 1941-45. We are indebted to Laura Summers for this information. The CIA-supported Khmer Serei also operated in this area from Thai bases for many years. As we shall see below, Lon Nol conducted brutal attacks on the peasants of the region in the early 1950s. Thus there is a long historical background that helps explain why this region should be the focus of violent revenge.

At one time, most of the country looked like a gigantic lake. Much of the vast Tonle Sap-Mekong basin is still under water. There seems little doubt that the waters have brought new hardships to this unhappy country.” To the surprise of most observers, the grim prediction does not appear to have been realized, though we have yet to read a comment on this fact or its import in the major media.

[96](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt96). During the U.S. war in Vietnam, it was common for reporters and others to comment on the curious “xenophobia” of the Vietnamese, which makes it so hard to deal with them. Apparently it is a curious trait of peasant culture, as yet unexplained by contemporary scholarship, to react with a demonstration of xenophobia when foreign powers drop cluster bombs on villages after many years of colonial domination. Yet another aspect of the mysterious Asian mind.

See also note 48.











Another example is a widely published photo taken by the West German journalist Christopher Maria Froder, showing a Khmer Rouge soldier brandishing a weapon, according to the photographer, to prevent looting of shops in Phnom Penh after its liberation on 17 April 1975. The picture appeared in the Far Eastern Economic Review, 14 April 1978, with the caption “Khmer Rouge takeover: Savage Repression.” The Review refused to publish a letter by Torben Retbøll noting that after the photo had appeared in Die Welt (West Germany, 9 May 1975) with the claim that the soldier was looting, and in Der Stern (29 April 1976) with the caption: “After the victory, there followed the revenge against the rich,” the photographer protested the falsification on German TV (the facts were correctly reported in the West German Befreiung). But on 15 August 1976, the Sunday Telegraph (London) again published the photo as an illustration of Khmer Rouge brutality as did Newsweek in the issue just cited. Retbøll’s appeared in News from Kampuchea (Australia), vol. 2, no. 2, November/December 1978, to an international audience of 500 people. The same picture appeared in the Washington Post (9 May 1975, with the caption: “Khmer Rouge soldier angrily orders Phnom Penh shopkeepers into streets”), and again in the New York Times Magazine (Henry Kamm, “The Agony of Cambodia,” 19 November 1978), this time with the caption: “Conquering Pnom [sic] Penh in 1975, a Khmer Rouge soldier rounds up merchants,” illustrating that a good piece of propaganda never dies.






[102](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt102). There are many others. For example, one of the fabricated photographs appears in the Soviet journal Literaturnaja Gazeta, 4 October 1978, in an article devoted to atrocities in Cambodia that quotes extensively from the U.S. press. Torben Retbøll has informed us of a number of Western European examples: Der Spiegel, 30 January 1978, who refused to print a letter of correction, like their U.S. counterparts; the Danish journal Ekstra Bladet, on three separate occasions (3 May 1976, 28 December 1977, and 4 January 1978); the London Observer (30 October 1977) on the front page.

Richard Holbrooke informed the Congressional Committee in the July Hearings that Twining, Carney and Kenneth Quinn, “form to my mind, the American core of expertise on Cambodian affairs today in the U.S. Government” (p. 2). As we shall see, Quinn also refers to this alleged interview, and may well be the source of its wide dissemination. Twining, when asked what public statements the Cambodian government has made about executions, replied: “The little that has been said publicly, when Khieu Samphan was in Colombo, for example ...” (p. 12). It is not clear whether he is referring to the “interview” or to Khieu Samphan’s statements at the Colombo meetings. Thus of the three specialists who form “the American core of expertise on Cambodian affairs today in the U.S. Government,” two cite this “interview” as genuine, perhaps three, depending on what Twining had in mind in this reference.

Retbøll, a Danish historian, is one of the small number of people in the West who care enough about the facts to pursue the details and write to journals that print false or dubious information, and like others, has been regularly subjected to vilification and abuse for this unwelcome commitment to the truth.

[117](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt117). See among others, Ieng Sary (interviewed in Der Spiegel, 9 May 1977, by Tiziano Terzani), who estimated the population at 7,760,000 and explicitly denied the reports by Barron-Paul and others of massacres (it is curious that one constantly reads that the Cambodian government had not denied these claims). In the May Hearings, after Porter had questioned the Famiglia Cristiana “interview” (noting that the Cambodian government has repeatedly estimated the population at 7.7 million), John Barron attempted to defend his use of the alleged interview, with the following claims: (1) “other Cambodian officials at approximately the same time had stated that there were 5 or 5.2 million inhabitants of Cambodia”; (2) “The figure of 7.7 million mentioned by Mr. Porter I have seen stated one time, and that was in a claim made shortly after the first anniversary of the revolution” denying massacre claims; (3) “I don’t know of anybody in the world who has ever contended that the population of Cambodia ever was that large.” As for (1), Barron cites no examples and we know of none. As for (2), he was probably referring to the Ministry of Information communique cited in note 104, which estimated the population at 7.7 million, a figure that has been repeated often. But the most surprising claim is (3). Ponchaud, Barron’s major nongovernmental source, writes that “in 1970 the population of Cambodia was usually estimated at 8 million” (including 400,000 Vietnamese); op. cit., p. 70. The UN estimated the population in mid-1974 at 7.89 million (see below, p. 264) and in mid-1976 at 8.35 million (cf. UN Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, February 1978). Swedish visitors to postwar Cambodia have reported that the population is 8 million and that efforts are being made to increase it to 15 million. Estimates in the 7-8 million range are standard. In their book, Barron and Paul write that “no one heretofore had contended that the prewar population of Cambodia was more than seven million ...” (p. 202n.)






[118](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt118). It has also been cited on television, e.g., by Leo Cherne of the International Rescue Committee, on the MacNeil/Lehrer Report (see note 53). He claims that when Khieu Samphan “was asked what is the population of Cambodia, he said five million. The population of Cambodia used to be 8 million.” Cherne notes that this estimate of five million is inconsistent with a population estimate offered by Pol Pot in “Peiping” (the name used for Peking by Dean Rusk, Leo Cherne and others of their political persuasion). This “disparity in the population of Cambodia” is offered as the sole example of “the most remarkable revelations” by Pol Pot. It is, of course, only a “remarkable revelation” to someone who relies on such sources as Famiglia Cristiana for his knowledge of international affairs. Recall that it is this “remarkable revelation” that Cherne relied upon to explain why executions have diminished (see note 37, this chapter). The above appears to be the intended sense of some rather confused remarks by Cherne. We rely on the written transcript, Library no. 702, Show no. 3242, 6 June 1978.

Torben Retbøll has brought to our attention that in this article, Quinn claims that Khieu Samphan “offered a partial explanation” for the reduction in population on grounds of war dead and the return of “600,000 ethnic Vietnamese” to Vietnam. But in fact nothing of the sort appears in the cited “interview.” If this “interview” is indeed an intelligence fabrication, as appears not unlikely, it may be that it went through several versions before being placed in Famiglia Cristiana, to be picked up by the world press.

[125](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt125). To add an unnecessary little extra, the same issue of Famiglia Cristiana contains an insert on Sihanouk, referring to “a suspicion, expressed in Le Monde August 8, that the entire family of the Prince has been exterminated.” Retbøll (op. cit.) points out that the reference is to a fabricated “appeal” published in good faith by Le Monde with the signatures of well-known French leftists. Two days later, Le Monde published an apology when it discovered that the signatures were forged—a fact not mentioned in the Famiglia Cristiana report. This fact alone might have suggested that this journal is hardly a trustworthy source, had the question been of any concern.






[126](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt126). See chapter 2 of this volume, p. 29-30, for one of many examples. It is difficult to imagine that the CIA, with its long history of deception in Indochina, has suddenly ceased its disinformation campaigns. Ed Bradley of CBS news, asked on the MacNeil/Lehrer Report to comment on the “allegation that there is a disinformation network at work spreading these allegations” of Cambodian atrocities, responded: “I don’t have any doubts that there is some element of truth in it...,” a plausible surmise. The alleged “interview” is not found in the regular FBIS translations though it does appear in a special “For Official Use Only” supplement to the Daily Report for Asia and Pacific. Thus it is not available to regular library subscribers, but presumably is available to selected individuals to whom it can be “leaked.” We are indebted to Stephen Heder for this information.

In Nouvel Observateur, 2 October 1978, Lacouture gave the same wording as a quote, attributed to Khmer Rouge cadres: the new generation charged with the building of Cambodia “needs only a million and a half to two million Cambodians to construct the country,” (his emphasis). This article is an excerpt from Lacouture’s October 1978 book Survive le peuple cambodgien!, Seuil, 1978. As we shall see directly, this reference appears in print over a year after Ponchaud, a close associate of Lacouture’s, had withdrawn the quote and his interpretation of it as apparently without credible source.











Quite apart from the discrepancy of source and the changes in numbers and text (not to speak of the dubious source, to which we return), it is hardly clear that Khmer Rouge military commanders or whoever might have been the source for this remark, if anyone, “talk of Marxism.” Specialists have noted that the Khmer Rouge leadership tended to stress independence, nationalism, manual labor, equality, etc., but not Marxism. According to Carney, Marxism-Leninism made its appearance in domestic radio broadcasts only in 1976. Timothy M.

This translation was evidently supervised by Ponchaud, since there are some revisions of the French original as well as new material. See note 395, this chapter.











Skepticism about the source of this alleged quote had already been expressed by Gareth Porter (May Hearings, pp. 51-52), properly, it is now clear. Ponchaud’s qualifications in his letter regarding the quote are noted by Malcolm Caldwell (Manchester Guardian, 8 May 1978). He comments: “Yet, without a move on Ponchaud’s part to correct the misuse, the construction of threatening a systematic massacre is the one still put on it by authors determined to slander Kampuchea at any cost to honesty and integrity.” This comment takes on added weight now that Ponchaud has deleted from the American edition both the “quote” and the inference drawn from it.

[145](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt145). This egregious comment is typical of the colonialist mentality. While the friends and associates of Westerners in Phnom Penh may have been “fun-loving” and “easy-going” as they enjoyed themselves at the expense of the peasant population, the latter appear to have endured a rather different existence, a matter to which we return.

[147](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt147). In the same review, Wise claims that Ponchaud dismisses the excuse that Phnom Penh was emptied to avoid famine as “rubbish” because “there was enough stocked rice to feed between 2.5 million and three million people ...” Compare what Ponchaud actually wrote: This explanation for the evacuation, “given as the essential one, is not fully convincing.” The “more than 1.5 million peasants” who had been driven into Phnom Penh “were all eager to return to their homes without being forced to go” and as for the rest of the population, stocks of rice on hand “might have fed it for two months, with careful rationing” (at which point, presumably, they would have starved to death). Op. cit., pp. 20-21. Note further that on inquiry Ponchaud concedes that his estimate may have been exaggerated. See below, p. 312. But for Wise, Ponchaud has shown the explanation to be “rubbish.” This explanation was, as Ponchaud states, commonly given as the essential one. See the comments by Ieng Sary, reported from Tokyo, AP, Washington Post (14 June 1978) for one example.











Wise also makes the following curious remark: Ponchaud “eloquently smothers the naive theories of alleged experts who—even before Ponchaud’s book appeared—had decided there were no massacres after the communists took Phnom Penh in 1975 ...” (his emphasis). He cites no such “experts.” Note also Wise’s curious implication that prior to the appearance of Ponchaud’s book in January 1977 it was somehow illegitimate to draw conclusions—at least, the unauthorized ones—about Cambodia.

[155](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt155). The official Cambodian government estimate was 200,000. See Ieng Sary’s interview in Spiegel (cited in note 117.)

In keeping with the theory of the Free Press, it was not subject to censorship and the information it presented about Cambodia was available to the Western reader, journalists included. In further confirmation of the same theory, its documentation and positive accounts of postwar Cambodia reached an audience of about 500 people throughout the world.

[170](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt170). Henry Kamm, “Cambodian Refugees Depict Growing Fear and Hunger,” New York Times, 13 May 1978. As both the Post and Times correctly reported, the Yugoslav journalists said they saw no signs of food shortages. Once again Kamm notes that some of the refugees he interviewed were in a “small cage” in a police station, others in a “disused prison” and refugee camps, where “their bearing and comportment recall concentration camp survivors in the Europe of 1945”—a fact that conceivably relates to the conditions of their detention. See p. 162 above.






[171](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt171). The same “implicit restrictions” prevented them from raising questions about atrocities, he explains. Kamm’s remarks on “communist fraternalism” are no doubt appropriate, though Yugoslavia has been known on occasion to exhibit some slight degree of independence, one recalls. But more to the point, Kamm neglects to mention the “implicit restrictions” imposed by “capitalist fraternalism.” For example, those that enable a Pulitzer-Prize winning specialist on the misery of refugees to inform his reading public that refugees in Timor are fleeing from the mountains where they have been “forced to live” by FRETILIN guerrillas; this apparently on the authority of a kindly Indonesian general, not—perish the thought—interviews with refugees. Unlike Cambodian refugees in Thai prisons, these unlucky souls are not proper subjects for a reporter of such independence of mind. See Volume I, chapter 3, section 5.4.






[172](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt172). William Shawcross also reports that “The Yugoslav journalists were shocked by the extent of child labor,” and reports the same account of the filming. “Cambodia Today: a Land of Blood and Tears,” New Times, 13 November 1978. The subheading of this story (which is featured on the front cover) includes the statement that “Cambodia today is a ‘hell on earth.’” As the story itself indicates, this is a quote from Hanoi radio, which has rarely been regarded as a reliable source in Western journalism, but is taken quite seriously when it provides negative information about Cambodia in the midst of a bitter war. See note 18, above.











The concern of Western journalists over child labor is rather selective. A rare report on the topic filed from Thailand received little publicity in the United States and aroused no noticeable outrage: Amport Tantuvanich, AP, “Slavery the fate of these children,” Boston Globe (24 September 1978). The report describes children working in Thai factories “hour after hour without a break around furnaces that generate 1450-degree heat. Their arms and hands bear scars from burns and cuts...” There are tens of thousands of illegally employed children, some “sold by their parents to factory owners” and working as “virtual slaves.” “A recent survey by the International Labor Organization in Geneva showed that of 52 million children under age 15 at work around the world, 29 million are working in South Asia.” Many of the Thai laborers are under 10. “Labor specialists say that a combination of wide-open free enterprise and a lack of labor-union power contributes to the child labor problem. Under laws laid down by Thailand’s military government, strikes and other labor union activities are forbidden.” On the U.S. role in creating this situation, see Volume I, chapter 4, section 2. See also the preface to this volume.











Another example is the notable exploitation of child labor from the occupied territories in Israel. At the “Children’s Market at the Ashkelon junction” one finds children aged six or seven trucked in by labor contractors at 4 a.m. to work on the private or collective farms in the vicinity, helping to make the desert bloom for their prosperous employers who pay them “a meager subsistence wage” though “often they are cheated even on that.” Ian Black, “Peace or no peace, Israel will still need cheap Arab labor,” New Statesmen, 29 September 1978. The miserable conditions of child labor (and Arab labor from the occupied territories in general) have been discussed and deplored in Israel (see, for example, Amos Elon, “Children’s market at the Ashkelon junction,” Ha’aretz, 2 August 1978), with no effect on the practice, however. The matter has yet to be discussed in the mainstream U.S. press, to our knowledge, surely not by those who are so deeply offended by child labor in Cambodia, a major atrocity that evokes memories of Hitler and Stalin.











Visiting Cambodia in the summer of 1978, Gunnar Bergstrom reports that he saw children working in the fields, mixing work with play in a manner not unfamiliar in peasant societies. See note 180, below. See also the reports cited in note 190, below.

[176](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt176). “US Leftist Editor Says Cambodians Are Thriving,” New York Times (12 May 1978). Six months later, a column by Burstein appeared on the Op-Ed page of the Times (“On Cambodia: But, Yet,” 21 November 1978), two days after the New York Times Magazine published a major story by Henry Kamm, to which we return. Burstein’s brief statement based on what he says he saw is “opinion”; Kamm’s lengthy account of what he says he heard from refugees is “fact.” Professor David Sidorsky of Columbia University denounced the Times for printing this “propagandistic opinion on questions of fact,” (letter, 5 December). He did not criticize the Times for publishing Kamm’s article with its faked photos, allegations about starvation taking no account of direct testimony to the contrary by visitors, etc. Nor did he criticize the Times for withholding evidence provided by visitors. Rather, his criticism was limited to the Burstein Op-Ed statement for not presenting factual evidence, as was obviously impossible in the space provided him.











In contrast to the coverage in the United States, visits by Danish Communists received substantial publicity in the Danish press, we are informed by Torben Retbøll. (Note that some of the visitors whose reports were suppressed in the Free Press were non-Communists, and there is little doubt that they would have been treated rather differently had their reports conformed to the propaganda line.) A detailed report by these visitors appears in The Call (P.O. Box 5597, Chicago Ill. 60680), May 15, 22, 29, June 5, 12, 1978; The Young Communist, June/July 1978; Class Struggle, Summer 1978. There was also a report in the Guardian (New York, 7 June 1978). See also Kampuchea Today, Call Pamphlets, December 1978, and a “photo-record” of their visit by David Kline and Robert Brown, The New Face of Kampuchea. Liberator Press, 1979. They say their trip covered 700 miles with frequent stops and discussions with government leaders and others.






[177](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt177). We regret that we cannot comment here on television news, since we have no records. We have cited the MacNeil/Lehrer Report on Cambodia on the basis of a transcript. Burstein informs us privately that lower-echelon reporters and editors were helpful and sympathetic, but that the idea was apparently killed at a higher level, a process not exactly unfamiliar to us personally. See the prefatory note to Volume I.

[179](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt179). See Volume I, chapter 3, section 5.4; this volume, chapter 4. Note that his distortions are systematic; his extreme bias is consistently towards service to the U.S. government propaganda system, whether he is dismissing the testimony of refugees and other victims in Timor and relying on Indonesian generals, or dismissing the testimony of visitors to Cambodia and relying on what he claims to hear from refugees in Thai police cages, or grossly misrepresenting the available evidence from Vietnam.






[180](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt180). We rely on an hour-long taped interview in English, readily available to enterprising reporters, no doubt. Bergstrom has a number of interesting things to say, and seems careful and qualified in his account. For example, he visited areas where there was alleged to be insurrection, but saw no signs of disturbance and no security presence. Reports by U.S. journalists to the same effect many months later were front page news. As already noted, the work pace seemed to him moderate by European standards. He gives many details of the life he observed, and in general, reports a peasant society rebuilding with some success from the ruins, noting, however, that his access was limited.






[181](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt181). Mary McGrory, “Slow reaction to Cambodia bloodbath,” Boston Globe, 27 November 1978. As the title indicates, the central point is that “for a while, Cambodia was hardly discussed,” though finally, by mid-1978, it is receiving some attention. The statement is totally false, but, as we have seen, in keeping with the constant pretense of writers who send this message to their mass audience in the Reader’s Digest, TV Guide, and the major journals, or in the more select periodicals.






[182](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt182). Boston Globe, 19 November 1978. On the same day, the Globe reports that “the Inter-American Human Rights Commission yesterday accused the Nicaraguan National Guard of murdering scores of unarmed civilians” in September, charging that “entire families were machine-gunned to death in their homes,” that unarmed youths “were allegedly forced to dig their own graves before they were executed,” along with other atrocities. This story made page 78. The preceding day a brief AP report noted that “despite pleas from the Nicaraguan opposition the Carter Administration has decided against trying to prevent Israel from supplying light arms to the regime of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle, Administration sources said yesterday.” None of this is major news, however and it elicited no editorial or other comment. On November 18 the New York Times reported (also not prominently, and in this case with no descriptive detail at all) that the Commission had accused the Nicaraguan Government “of flagrant, persistent abuses of human rights, including summary executions, torture, arbitrary detention, indiscriminate bombing of unarmed civilians and obstructing the humanitarian efforts of the Red Cross”; the government’s “practices had victimized all sectors of the population but particularly the poor and people between the ages of 14 and 21.” Nothing is said about the long-standing relation between the United States and Nicaragua. See Volume I, chapter 4, section 5.2.

[185](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt185). The New York Times is also not noted for outraged denunciations of gross differences in living standards in the United States. In New York City, for example, one can easily discover wealth that surpasses description only a short distance away from hovels where a grandmother stays awake through the night with a club to prevent rats from killing a child who will go to school the next day without breakfast.

[188](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt188). Jack Anderson, “Lon Nol in Exile: Sad Symbol of Cambodia,” Washington Post (1 October 1978). Some of Lon Nol’s exploits in this “serene little country” in the 1970s are well-known. See, for example, Volume I, chapter 3, section 2. Anderson’s mythical picture of prewar Cambodia is a very common one. Among many examples, an advertisement for a CBS news special on Cambodia reads: “Once, Cambodia was a very special place. Lively, Happy, Peaceful.” New York Times (1 June 1978). The myth provides a useful backdrop for the picture of merciless horror and madness. See note 232, below.

[190](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt190). Richard Dudman published an edited version of his series in a special supplement to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch (15 January 1979): “Cambodia: A land in turmoil.” Elizabeth Becker’s series appeared in the Washington Post, December 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 1978 (along with a December 24 story on Malcolm Caldwell’s assassination in Phnom Penh). These accounts were serialized in many journals in the United States and elsewhere as they appeared in late December. Our quotes from Dudman are from the edited version cited.






[191](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt191). Bernard Weinraub, “High-Level Purge in Cambodian Regime Reported,” New York Times (29 December 1978). Weinraub attributes this opinion to “American analysts.” Times ideologists continued to disregard the reports by the U.S. journalists, just as they had dismissed earlier testimony from reputable non-Communist observers that was unacceptable on doctrinal grounds. Thus Dudman reports that “with good opportunity for observation” he found “an assurance of apparently adequate food” and no signs of malnutrition, confirming the reports of earlier visitors. But for Henry Kamm it is a matter of dogma that Communist policy has caused starvation (“Although the growing of rice was declared the supreme national objective and almost the entire nation was set to work at this task, the Cambodian people, for the first time in their history, learned hunger”—and contradicting himself in the very next sentence: “Until the war disrupted their lives, [hunger] was perhaps the one scourge of life that Cambodians had always been spared,” which is false as well as inconsistent with what precedes). To maintain the dogma with its accompanying “mystery” already noted, it is necessary to ignore the reported facts, as Kamm does, in this article written a month after the accounts by the visiting U.S. journalists were widely circulated. Henry Kamm, “The Cambodian Dilemma,” New York Times Magazine, 4 February 1979, an “analysis” with accompanying moral lecture that merits no further comment.

[193](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt193). Becker states that the information in the Livre Noir “closely paralleled US intelligence estimates” of 1970. We know of no evidence that U.S. intelligence estimated in 1970 that there were 1.5-2 million “Vietcong” in Cambodia. Similarly, much of the other material in it does not parallel U.S. intelligence estimates, at least so far as the public record indicates. See Nayan Chanda, “The Black Book of Hatred,” Far Eastern Economic Review, 19 January 1979, for some discussion of the Livre Noir and also of conflicting Vietnamese claims in the two-volume Kampuchea Dossier published in Hanoi. See Heder’s articles cited in note 19 of the preface to this volume for detailed discussion of the background, including the longstanding conflict between Vietnamese and Cambodian Communists.






[194](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt194). They do, however, regularly accept documents and assessments produced in Hanoi and Phnom Penh prejudicial to the adversary, in the midst of a bitter conflict, on the principle that any negative information concerning a Communist regime, however questionable the source, must be accurate. See notes 18, 172 of this chapter.

[199](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt199). We have already commented on the localized nature of atrocity reports noted by a number of analysts, Twining included. Chandler observes that the reason may be that conditions elsewhere are better, or that it is more difficult to escape from other areas. Ponchaud (in his author’s note for the English translation) states that most of his reports come from the provinces near the Thai border, though “quite a few came from further away” (p. xv.). In an article published in January 1976 (N.B. after the worst atrocities; see above, note 37), Ponchaud wrote that Battambang-Siem Reap (i.e. the Northwest) is a region of “bloody violence more than any other”; cited by Porter, May Hearings, p. 24.

[202](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt202). The French also continually readjusted the border in a manner prejudicial to Cambodia. See the preface to this volume, note 20. On the vicious and barbaric French colonial impact on Vietnam, see the references cited in chapter 4, note 40; also note 67. Matters were little different in Cambodia. Chandler’s comments on the mythic “happiness” of the Cambodian peasants as seen by imperial interpreters can be supplemented by the studies cited in notes 2, 18; also Malcolm Caldwell and Lek Hor Tan, Cambodia, Monthly Review Press, 1973, and sources cited there, particularly Milton E. Osborne, The French Presence in Cochinchina and Cambodia, Cornell, 1969. Ponchaud, in contrast, writes that “to any Western visitor Cambodia was a land of smiles” (the standard cliché; see Meyer, op. cit.): “There did not seem to be any major social or agrarian problems” and “French colonization brought order and peace” though there were injustices that could be “exploited” by “an intelligent propaganda campaign,” Cambodia: Year Zero, pp. 140f.)






[203](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt203). Ponchaud writes: “During the reign of Sihanouk and then under Lon Nol, methods used by the government forces in dealing with their Khmer Rouge enemies were no less savage than those subsequently employed by Democratic Kampuchea: between 1968 and 1970 prisoners from Samlaut or Dambar, the cradles of the Khmer revolution, were bound to trees with their stomachs cut open and left to die; others, hurled off the cliffs of Bokor, agonized for days: enemy villages were razed and the villagers clubbed to death by local peasants who had been set against them.” Ibid., 140. This account is corroborated from other sources. The events elicited no reaction in the West, and are now generally dismissed or ignored (by Ponchaud as well as others) as a possible reason for subsequent savagery.

See also Malcolm Caldwell, “Cambodia—Rationale for a Rural Policy,” a five-part study presented at the Seminar “Underdevelopment and Subsistence Reproduction in Southeast Asia,” University of Bielefeld, 21-23 April 1978. This is a preliminary draft, never completed, which we hope will be published with Caldwell’s papers. See also the report on Thailand cited by Michael Vickery, p. 253, below. Also Denzil Peiris, “The student principles,” Far Eastern Economic Review, 2 June 1978, explaining how the “economic restructuring” of Cambodia had been following Khieu Samphan’s ideas in his thesis, and also outlining these ideas.

[207](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt207). On this matter, Ponchaud writes: “The economy inherited by Democratic Kampuchea had been totally devastated by the war.” The South Vietnamese “unhesitatingly demolished a large part of the economic infrastructure of the Cambodian territory,” and the United States bombed the rubber plantations, while the soldiers of the Lon Nol regime, “following their instructors’ example, buried their own country under their bombs and shells” and the Khmer Rouge “razed everything in their path that could in any way be connected with the West.” ibid., p. 85.






[208](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt208). See notes 202, 207, above. Ponchaud’s reference to “their instructors’ example” is more accurate.






[209](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt209). Michael Vickery, “Looking Back at Cambodia,” Westerly, December 1976. Citations below are from the original manuscript, dated 10 August 1976.






[210](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt210). Vickery’s observation on the contradictory character of refugee stories reflects his personal experience in refugee camps; see above, p. 168. The contradictory character will naturally not emerge from accounts by reporters who proceed in the manner we have described. Note that when Vickery wrote in August 1976, refugee stories were, as he says, “the only first-hand source of news,” though the situation was gradually to change, as we have seen. It should also be noted that the “blackout on information” followed years of censorship under the Lon Nol government.






[211](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt211). “Anti-French maquis cum bandits, who controlled much of the countryside and in some cases probably had contact with the Viet Minh.”











The exact history and character of the Cambodian revolutionary movement and its antecedents is the subject of controversy that we will not attempt to review. Laura Summers informs us (personal communication) that the Issarak movement was supported by the Thai resistance opposing the Japanese in World War II (the allies refused assistance, fearing their reformist social programs). Based in the Thai-occupied provinces of the northwest, it was officially recognized by the Thai resistance government in 1944 and received support from both Siamese and Vietnamese. “Prior to joining the Independence movement most Khmer Issarak were peasants, monks or intellectuals (teachers).” Summers further comments that Lon Nol had been involved in Battambang politics in earlier years, having been appointed to reestablish the local Khmer administration in the region in 1946 and serving as Provincial Governor of Battambang from 1947 to 1949. As for the scale of the military activity of the 1953-54 period, Summers informs us that there were 10,000 armed guerrillas operating in Cambodia in January 1953, 8,000 of them Issaraks divided into several tendencies, less than 2,000 Viet Minh.






[212](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt212). On political violence perpetrated by the Sihanouk regime, see Heder’s forthcoming article in the Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars (cited in the preface, note 19) where he describes, for example, a speech by Sihanouk in August 1968 “in which he claimed to have put to death over 1,500 communists since 1967 and stated that, if necessary, he would persist in such a policy of merciless extermination until the [Communist Party] submitted” (we quote from the manuscript). This statement, and others like it, aroused no more outcry in the West than the violent repression carried out by the regime.






[213](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt213). The reference, clearly, is to the leadership in Phnom Penh and their supporters, not to the peasants driven into the city by the war. T.D. Allman had described Phnom Penh as a city “shared by two separate nations: the poor, the refugees, the ordinary people, their lives torn and complicated by the war beyond imagination; and the political elite for whom the war has meant promotions and a revived sense of their own importance ...” (“Forever Khmer,” Far Eastern Economic Review, 4 September 1971).






[214](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt214). Timothy Carney notes that “sometime in 1973 the party apparently decided to accelerate its program to alter Khmer society...,” for no cited reason. Carney, ed., op. cit., p. 21. The most interesting material in this collection is a translation of Ith Sarin, “Nine months with the maquis,” excerpted from a 1973 book written in an effort to rally opposition to the Khmer Rouge. It gives some insight, from a very hostile source, into the success of the Khmer Rouge in gaining popular support by conscientiously following the maxims of “serve the people,” “study from the people in order to be like the people,” etc. We have been informed that the sections of Ith Sarin’s book that do not appear in Carney’s excerpts give a rather favorable description of Communist social and economic programs and that the book was banned by the Lon Nol government as being more harmful than beneficial to its cause.






[215](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt215). Kissinger succeeded in duping the compliant media into believing that he was simply seeking a “decent interval” after the U.S. departure from Vietnam, but some attention to his actual statements as well as to the unfolding events reveals quite clearly that the aim was military victory in defiance of the Paris Agreements of January 1973, as was pointed out at once, though generally ignored by the press. See the references of chapter 1, note 1.






[216](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt216). A secondary goal was no doubt to eliminate a rear base for the resistance in Vietnam. According to Snepp, intelligence gathered in 1970 revealed that nearly 80% of the supplies for Communist forces in the southern half of South Vietnam were sent through Cambodia.

[225](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt225). On this matter, Vickery writes (personal communication): “I am convinced, however, that a good bit of Cambodian policy since the end of the war has been inspired by good old-fashioned vengeance and that the revolution could have been carried out more gently. This possibly gratuitous violence would have no connection with a ‘Communist,’ or ‘Marxist,’ or ‘Maoist’ orientation of the new leaders, but, I believe, would be well within the limits of traditional Cambodian personality and culture as I came to understand them during a residence of five years there.” Cf. Meyer, op. cit., (see note 2) for an analysis of Cambodia that lends support to this interpretation, which, however, is unhelpful for the needs of current propaganda.






[226](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt226). We quote from the transcript, for which we are indebted to Torben Retbøll, who is preparing a study of the Hearings. We have changed only spelling, punctuation and some obvious misprints and grammatical errors.











On Meyer’s own reaction to the hearings, see Dagens Nyheter (Stockholm), 23 April 1978 (translated in FBIS, 27 April 1978, Cambodia, H2), where he is quoted as saying: “I know I have been lured into a trap here in Oslo. It has been a question of judging and condemning the new Cambodia and not of trying to understand what has happened there.” Of the various participants, Meyer was undoubtedly the one most familiar with Cambodian history, society and culture, in fact the only one to have written on Cambodia apart from the war and postwar period, to our knowledge.






[227](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt227). See note 2. In a review of Meyer’s book in the Journal of the Siam Society (January 1973, volume 61, Part I, pp. 310-25), Laura Summers describes him as “one of Sihanouk’s closest associates” and “without doubt the most prominent of [Sihanouk’s large contingent of French advisors] because of his enormous influence in all areas of foreign and domestic policy making and notably in domestic economic planning...By 1961, it was widely acknowledged that he was almost as powerful as Sihanouk.” Summers raises serious questions about Meyer’s interpretation of the Khmer peasantry and in particular “his psychologizing of essentially social phenomena [which] prevents him from fully understanding the emergence of leftist movements ...” She notes particularly his avoidance of “any implication of French colonialism” and the “colonial bias” of his account, and his implicit rejection of the possibility that the Khmer peasants might have been capable of making rational decisions for themselves on the basis of their perception of social reality. We need hardly add that it is not because of these characteristics of his writing that Meyer’s book and the statement to which we turn have been ignored in the United States. In fact, like Sihanouk himself, Meyer was regarded as a dangerous radical by U.S. officials, we have been informed.






[228](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt228). Context suggests that he has in mind the Vietnamese. He writes: “However, it must not be so that the accusations against the regime in Cambodia—even if they to a certain extent are justified—become the pretext of a Vietnamese intervention for a pretended liberation of the Khmer people.” On this warning and the failure to heed it, see the preface to this volume.

[231](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt231). About this event, Ponchaud writes only that “until recently the general tone of relations between Khmers and French was one of mutual friendship. With one exception: the measures adopted by Charles Thomson in 1884, during the Jules Ferry government, which made the Khmers very angry. The effect of the measures was to deprive the sovereign of all but symbolic power, and this led to a full-scale rebellion.” That seems a little thin for the massacre of 20% of the population. Cambodia: Year Zero, p. 145.






[232](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt232). Elsewhere, she points out that yields were considerably lower than those of Cambodia’s Southeast Asian neighbors before the war. “Consolidating the Cambodian Revolution.”











See also Virginia Thompson, French Indo-china (Macmillan, 1942). She comments on the misery of the Khmers despite the country’s potential and actual wealth, the decimation of the population by foreign and internal strife, the indebtedness and lack of credit facilities other than usury for the small proprietors, and the fact that “the population is ever on the edge of starvation” (pp. 338ff.). See also Ben Kiernan, “Peasant life and society in Kampuchea before 1970,” mimeographed, Monash University (Australia), 1978. He reports that the official termination of slavery in 1897 had little impact in some districts and that even for peasants who were free, the majority throughout the period were at a subsistence level, with low yields, frequent hunger and even starvation, and a sharp decline in landholdings for about 80% of farmers from 1930 to 1950. In short, hardly a picture of “order and peace” in a land without “any major social or agrarian problems” (Ponchaud) for the “fun-loving, easy-going Cambodians” (Donald Wise), or a land that had never known hunger until it fell into the hands of the evil Communists (Henry Kamm), a “gentle land” of “happy smiles” as depicted by many Western journalists and casual visitors.

[236](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt236). Note that this exposure of the fakery was long before the international publicity afforded these fabrications, which still continues unaffected by fact, as we have seen.






[237](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt237). Barron and Paul visited refugee camps in October and November, and also interviewed refugees elsewhere. See above, p. 162, on their mode of access to refugees. Ponchaud’s interviews with refugees were also from the same period. Ponchaud based his book, he writes, on written accounts by 94 Khmer refugees, 77 in Thailand and 17 in Vietnam, and interviews with hundreds of illiterate refugees, mostly from the “laboring classes.” He identifies only the 94 literate refugees: all middle or upper class with the possible exception of “seven ordinary soldiers,” “four Khmer Rouge,” “three bonzes,” “two fishermen,” “a provincial guard,” “a truck driver,” “a warehouseman.” Cambodia: Year Zero, p. x.






[238](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt238). He notes that Western and Thai journalists in Bangkok as well as U.S. officials in the refugee camps concur with this analysis.






[239](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt239). Sophi’s account; see above, p. 243.






[240](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt240). Ponchaud writes that in some areas agricultural work was dangerous after the war “because of the unexploded bombs and shells lurking in the grass or brush.” In one region northwest of Phnom Penh, “a day never went by without several villagers being injured or killed by explosions.” Cambodia: Year Zero, p. 56. These deaths and injuries, like those from starvation, disease, and overwork caused by the killing of draught animals, are included among “Khmer Rouge atrocities” in the fanciful tabulations offered by the Western media. When he was evacuated from Phnom Penh in May, 1975, Ponchaud passed through villages where he saw “vestiges of the dreadful American air warfare.” In conversation, villagers referred to T-28 bombing (including napalm) as the most terrible part of the war, worse than the B-52s. He also passed “a huge cemetery where thousands of revolutionary fighters were buried,” a testimony to the nature of the war. Ibid., pp. 37-38. Such observations rarely found their way to commentary on the book.






[241](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt241). Recall that Ponchaud’s book is known primarily through second- or third-hand accounts. Much of Kiernan’s article in Australian Outlook is based on interviews with refugees in Bangkok and camps in Thailand from December 1975 to February 1976. As noted above, there were 10,200 Cambodian refugees in Thailand in August 1976; the January 1976 figure was about 9,300 (Kiernan, personal communication).






[242](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt242). There is unlikely to be a serious and comprehensive study of refugees, in part because of Thai refusal to permit serious scholars to conduct research among refugees (see p. 168, above), in part because of the changed situation after the Vietnamese invasion.











We hope that further comment is unnecessary on the significance of Kiernan’s analysis for investigation of the workings of the Western propaganda system with regard to Cambodia. Later events and discoveries, whatever they may be, quite plainly—as a simple point of logic—have no bearing on an evaluation of what the media have been churning out on the basis of research in 1976.











Subsequent analysis of the later period, should it be undertaken, would have to consider the impact of a two-front war that was particularly violent on the Vietnamese side in 1977 and involved continued attacks by the CIA-trained Khmer Serei on the Thai side (cf. R.-P. Paringaux, Le Monde, 28-29 August 1977). For a skeptical view about events on the Thai border, see Norman Peagam, Far Eastern Economic Review, 11 February 1977; for an eyewitness account of Cambodian atrocities on the Vietnamese side of the border see Nayan Chanda, FEER, 31 March 1978, and for a prescient analysis of “the seriousness of Cambodia’s predicament” in a highly unequal battle see Chanda, FEER, 11 August 1978. The border conflicts undoubtedly had a severe impact within Cambodia. It is quite senseless to exclude them from consideration in interpreting internal events in Cambodia in the postwar period, as is not uncommon. See Heder’s papers cited earlier for extensive discussion.

[244](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt244). Note that his estimate is at the lower end of Twining’s estimated “thousands or hundreds of thousands. Recall also the estimates by Carney and Holbrooke cited above as well as those by Cambodia watchers cited by Simons (p. 182).

[247](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt247). FEER. Whether Chanda is correct in attributing the use of force to uneducated peasants, we are not qualified to say. We should remark, however, that modern history offers little basis for the belief that uneducated peasants are more given to savagery, violence or terror than sophisticated Western intellectuals. Quite the contrary. Similarly, we wonder whether there is any source of peasant origin that offers justification for massacre and annihilation in the manner, say, of Guenter Lewy’s highly praised America in Vietnam, on which we have commented several times.

Schanberg (New York Times, 9 May 1975): the Khmer Rouge were “peasant boys, pure and simple—darker skinned than their city brethren, with gold in their front teeth. To them the city is a curiosity, an oddity, a carnival, where you visit but do not live...When they looted jewelry shops, they kept only one watch for themselves and gave the rest to their colleagues or passersby.” On the peasant army, see also the comments by Peang Sophi and by Jean-Jacques Cazaux, cited below, p. 331-32.

[263](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt263). Methods aside, most observers believe it to have been a necessity. See, e.g., the comments by Poole (p. 176) and many others. See also notes 273, 313, and p. 191.






[264](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt264). Their observations are corroborated by other sources; see Hildebrand and Porter, op. cit., pp. 50f. See also the eyewitness report of the situation in the hospitals at the time of the Khmer Rouge takeover by Jon Swain, Sunday Times (London), 11 May 1975: “Hundreds of people were being subjected to a hideous death” at a hospital where doctors “had not reported for work for two days, and there was no one to treat the two thousand wounded.” People were bleeding to death in the corridors or in wards caked with blood and thick with flies. A nurse explained that the doctors simply stayed away, while “the dead and dying lay in pools of their own blood,” including a Khmer Rouge “who had somehow been brought there for treatment.” In dismay, Swain and his journalist colleagues “sloshed our way through the blood to the exit.” Reports by Swain and others indicate that the subsequent Khmer Rouge evacuation of the hospitals was a brutal affair, but perhaps the scene they observed is relevant to understanding the evacuation policy.











Swain’s lengthy and horrifying account contrasts with the brief mention by his companion, Sydney Schanberg of the New York Times, who describes the evacuation vividly and notes that many of the miserable patients forcefully evacuated will have little chance of survival, but of the situation in Phnom Penh he says only that “many of the wounded were dying for lack of care” (New York Times, 9 May 1975; in an accompanying dispatch headed “American’s Brief Brush With Arrest and Death,” he writes: “Doctors and surgeons, out of fear, had failed to come to work and the wounded were bleeding to death in the corridors”). He believes that the Khmer Rouge who threatened him and his companions as they left the hospital may have been angry because “they wanted no foreign witnesses” to the evacuation, though a reading of Swain’s account of the same visit raises questions about the alternatives.






[265](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt265). Richard Boyle, Flower of the Dragon, Ramparts Press, 1972. Boyle filed a story on the exodus from Phnom Penh for Pacific News Service (30 June 1975). In it he reports having seen the Calmette hospital “now administered by the Khmer Rouge,” “relay station and rest stops along the road out of Phnom Phenh, where Khmer Rouge troops—mostly women—and Buddhist monks supplied refugees with food and water” and “an orderly exodus, in which refugees moved at a leisurely pace on bicycles, ox-carts and on foot.” He states that “not one of the 1100 foreign nationals, including about 20 journalists, who left on the two convoys provided by the Khmer Rouge ever witnessed any bodies abandoned on the roadside,” contradicting a White House intelligence memo cited by Jack Anderson, Washington Post, 23 June 1975. He believes the evacuation to have been justified by horrendous conditions in Phnom Penh, which he describes: squalid refugee camps, severe malnutrition and disease, patients in hospitals dying from gangrene and suffering from lack of treatment unless they were wealthy, lack of doctors (who fled), destruction of water filtration plants and power lines by “secret police agents” (“By the evening of 17 April, there was no power in many parts of the city, and the water supply was running out”), “a dwindling food supply.” French medical doctors at Calmette, the only functioning hospital, told him that they “feared an epidemic of bubonic plague, or even worse, cholera or typhoid.” He claims further that the Khmer doctors who remained treated patients “too sick to make the journey into the countryside” and that the evacuation was “systematic and well-planned” so far as he could see. He questions the charge in Newsweek by its photographer Dennis Cameron that the Khmer Rouge mistreated civilians, noting that “the magazine failed to produce a single photo from Cameron to substantiate his charge.” Boyle’s account did not appear in the national media, or elsewhere in the press, to our knowledge. Other reports from European journalists giving a similar account of the evacuation are cited by Retbøll (“Kampuchea and ‘the Reader’s Digest’”), who notes that given the resources of the Reader’s Digest, their omission of evidence inconsistent with the Barron-Paul report “is not a matter of inadvertence but rather a conscious attempt to suppress evidence which might disprove or modify their own conclusions.” Retbøll also cites a statement by Lim Pech Kuon, one of the witnesses at the Oslo Hearings, who challenged Anthony Paul from the floor, saying “it is obvious that Paul does not know anything at all about Cambodia. Therefore it is not up to him to judge this country.”

[273](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt273). It is not easy to reconcile Leifer’s praise for the Barron-Paul book with his own observations and scholarly work. See, for example, his “Economic Survey” of Cambodia in The Far East and Australasia, Europa, 1976, pp. 431f., in which he observes that “the onset of war in Cambodia completely disrupted the economy...By April 1975, there was not a Cambodian economy, only the importation of foodstuffs financed by the United States government.” Thus the “first priority” for the Khmer Rouge “was declared to be the restoration of the national economy. Partly to this end, the urban centres, including the capital, were cleared of their inhabitants who were driven into the rural areas to work on the land and in other tasks of economic reconstruction. The initial rigours of the collectivization of agriculture were sustained at human cost but a good first harvest and the virtual rehabilitation of Cambodia’s small industrial sector, with Chinese technical assistance, placed the economy in a viable condition.” Given these facts, how can one give a favorable review to a book that excises from history all that precedes April 1975 and attributes the Draconian measures then instituted solely to Communist villainy?

His TV Guide article, based largely on Barron-Paul, is entitled “The Cambodian Blood Bath and The Great Silence.” The major theme is the “appalling” refusal of the media to take seriously “the murder of a million innocent people,’’ to be explained by the tendency of the media to overlook crimes that “are inflicted in the name of revolution.” Dr. Lefever “directs the Ethics and Public Policy Program of the Kennedy Institute of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and teaches international politics there,” TV Guide informs us. It should be borne in mind, difficult as it is to imagine, that material of this sort not only inundates a mass audience but is also taken seriously in allegedly “sophisticated” circles in the United States.

Wise also cites with approval Barron-Paul’s explanation of the more extreme policies as a consequence of Khieu Samphan’s alleged “impotence,” and other deep remarks.






[277](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt277). Paul Grimes, “Books of the Times,” New York Times, 31 August 1977. The word “however” refers to the Barron-Paul subtitle, “the untold story of Communist genocide in Cambodia.” The story “hasn’t been untold at all,” Grimes correctly observes, referring to a July 1975 story by Henry Kamm in the New York Times, one of the innumerably many since. See also the review in the New York Times Book Review, 11 September 1977, by Jean Lacouture, which again makes this point.






[278](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt278). Economist, 10 September 1977.






[279](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt279). For one of many examples, see Editorial, Christian Science Monitor, 26 January 1977, reporting the Barron-Paul conclusions with no question as to their authenticity, while deploring the “indifference in America and elsewhere to the fate of freedom under what appears to be one of the most brutal and concentrated onslaughts in history...in the lovely land and among the engaging people of Cambodia.” Like the authors of the book, the editors have conveniently forgotten an earlier onslaught on this lovely land. Their earlier concern for “the fate of freedom” for Cambodian peasants remains a closely-guarded secret.






[280](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt280). In the Nation, 25 June 1977, we commented on some of the more obvious inadequacies of the book.






[281](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt281). Manchester Guardian Weekly, 18 September 1977. Excerpts from the longer Guardian article appear in the Boston Globe (2 October 1977).











In conformity with the standard line, Woollacott alleges that Cambodian atrocities had previously been disregarded. “The American Right did not want to examine at all closely the kind of fate to which they had abandoned ‘their’ Cambodians. The whole array of Left-wing and liberal groups in the United States, France, and Britain, who had supported the Khmer Rouge cause, after some sophistry about the evacuation of the cities and some suggestions that the stories of executions were CIA ‘plants,’ more or less dropped Cambodia.” He does not refer us to sources for “the whole array of Left-wing and liberal groups” who took this stand, or explain how the regular condemnations of Cambodian genocide from mid-1975 in the mainstream press (New York Times, Time, etc.) comport with this version of the facts. He also states that “only when a figure as impressive as Jean Lacouture spoke out, as he did earlier this year, did a few Left-wingers timidly follow,” referring to the article by Lacouture that condemned Cambodian “autogenocide” on the basis of gross misrepresentation of Ponchaud. This paragraph was dropped by the Boston Globe, who were aware of the facts; see note 348, below. Woollacott also expresses his astonishment that the Cambodian revolutionaries had not “picked up...the essential humaneness of French life and thought,” as exemplified in Indochina for so many years, or in Algeria at the time when they were studying in Paris.






[282](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt282). New Statesman, 23 September 1977. Shawcross is impressed by the consistency of refugee reports, without, however, inquiring into the extent to which this is an artifact based on the selection process, not a small matter, as we have seen, particularly in the case of the book under review.

[284](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt284). Op. cit., p. viii.






[285](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt285). This scholarly criticism did not extend to the citations from his own work, as we have seen. Cf. pp. 203ff., above.

[287](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt287). Ibid., p. xiv.






[288](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt288). For example, Jon Swain’s comments, cited below. Barron and Paul refer in passing to the “fratricidal war” in which civilians were “caught up in the crossfire between government and insurgent battalions or killed by bombings” (p. 6). Now here is there any indication that the United States had anything to do with the destruction of the countryside. Equally scandalous is the reference to the U.S. “limited incursion” and the “devastating B-52 raids” which they depict, in accordance with government propaganda, as directed against North Vietnamese and Vietcong sanctuaries (p. 54). Missing from their “impeccable documentation, to cite only one relevant example, are the eyewitness reports by several U.S. correspondents (e.g., Richard Dudman, then a Khmer Rouge captive) of the impact of the U.S. “incursion” and aerial attack on Cambodian civilians. Nor do they take note of the subsequent destruction caused by the United States, or of course, the earlier U.S. interventions, military and otherwise, in Cambodia. See the references cited in notes 2, 45, 202, 204, for ample detail.











The absurdity of their assumption about the irrelevance of history was noted by William Shawcross (New York Review of Books, 4 March 1976), referring to their book then under preparation, evidently, with little effect.






[289](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt289). Op. cit., p. 203.






[290](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt290). In striking contrast with their freewheeling estimates about deaths in the postwar period (by definition, at the hands of Angka), they are properly skeptical about the figures of wartime casualties, which, they sternly admonish, are offered with no stated basis (p. 6n). To appreciate the humor of this remark, one must read through the “methodology” they offer for counting postwar casualties on pp. 203f. Carney, for what it is worth, takes the figure of one million to be a “close” estimate of wartime “killed or wounded.” July Hearings, p. 22.






[291](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt291). Our emphasis. Op. cit., p. 206.






[292](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt292). To be precise, their numbers are 430,000 or more from disease and starvation in the latter half of 1975 and 250,000 or more in 1976, plus 400,000 or more “during the first exodus,” presumably from disease and starvation.






[293](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt293). See Ponchaud, Cambodia: Year Zero, p. 71, citing “American Embassy sources,” which, he privately informs us, means the Bangkok Embassy. We write “allegedly produced” because no qualified person at the U.S. Embassy ever produced that figure, so we are informed. Charles Twining, who was the Indochina watcher at the U.S. embassy in Bangkok from 1975 to 1977, writes that there was never any “Embassy figure” of 1.2 million “or of any other dimension” and that although people in Bangkok naturally tried to arrive at estimates in their own minds as to the number of Cambodians who died from execution, or from disease or malnutrition, “these were purely private, and mostly short-lived, attempts.” Letter, 20 November 1978.






[294](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt294). See note 82.






[295](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt295). Op. cit., pp. 6, 28, 208.






[296](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt296). Perhaps the percentage of the population that voluntarily supported the Communists was as small as the minority that supported the American rebels in 1776-1783; see chapter 2, section 2.






[297](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt297). Op. cit., pp. 3-4.






[298](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt298). On this matter see note 418, below.






[299](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt299). That the Communists depicted the North Vietnamese as “our teachers” seems hardly likely, given their constant emphasis on independence and self-reliance and the long history of conflict between Cambodian and Vietnamese Communists. On the development of Cambodian Communist policy during this period, see Heder’s papers cited in the preface, note 19.






[300](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt300). Op. cit., pp. 54-55.






[301](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt301). Ibid., p. 61.






[302](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt302). For a serious account of how the Communist forces were built up from an estimated 5-10,000 in the pre-coup period (January 1968 to March 1970), despite opposition from the Vietnamese and Chinese, who opposed the armed struggle line of the Khmer Communist Party, see Heder, op. cit.






[303](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt303). Even the limited range of sources they cite in their “impeccable documentation” hardly supports their case. Thus under “paucity of popular support for the communists” (p. 214) we find the study edited by Carney, op. cit., which does indeed include the statement by a hostile critic who lived with the Khmer Rouge that the masses do not support them, though it also contains laments from the same source concerning their popularity and success. See note 214 above. Under the same heading they also cite Quinn’s study (see note 60), which gives ample evidence suggesting the contrary conclusion, as we have noted.






[304](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt304). Op. cit., p. 28.






[305](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt305). Recall that the Tarrs report having seen dead bodies on the streets. As many journalists have noted, it was difficult to decide whether dead that were seen were victims of the last stages of the fighting or postwar executions. Barron and Paul are quite certain, however. Their primary source, Ponchaud, saw no dead bodies (Cambodia: Year Zero, p. 24). See also the report by Lim Pech Kuon cited above, p. 167.






[306](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt306). Op. cit., p. 215.






[307](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt307). Not surprisingly, reports transmitted under such circumstances have low reliability. For example, Swain also reports that surgeon Bernard Piquart reported several atrocious acts by Khmer Rouge in the Calmette Hospital, a report corroborated by “other witnesses.” But Piquart seems to have had second thoughts. See note 267.






[308](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt308). Cf. chapter 2, section 2.






[309](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt309). Recall that people who have a considerable knowledge of Cambodia do not find these fellows so “un-Cambodian like”—cf., e.g. Meyer, p. 255, above; Vickery, note 225—though they are undoubtedly quite unlike those whom Meyer calls the “Western colonials” in Phnom Penh.






[310](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt310). Compare Barron and Paul, who keep strictly to the government propaganda line: whatever the facts, the U.S. was simply striking “communist sanctuaries” (p. 54), i.e., Vietnamese Communists, as the context makes clear.






[311](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt311). This is not the only example. To take another, while they quote Swain’s horrified account of the evacuation of the hospitals, they omit his equally horrified account of what he saw in a hospital before evacuation. See above, note 264.






[312](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt312). Cazaux and Juvenal, Washington Post (9 May 1975).






[313](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt313). This is in response to a surmise by some foreigners that only the strong will survive, so that the forced march is “genocide by natural selection.” Others, they say, “believe the depopulation of the cities was a necessary race against time to prepare the rice fields for a new planting. Food is very short now, and much farmland had been devastated by the war.”






[314](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt314). The Washington Post (9 May 1975) carries a story filed from Aranyaprathet (not Bangkok) compiled from unidentified news dispatches that contains reports that many refugees saw decomposing bodies or people who had been shot or apparently beaten to death, citing also Olle Tolgraven of Swedish Broadcasting who said “he did not believe there had been wholesale executions” though the Khmer Rouge may have shot people who refused to leave their homes when ordered to evacuate.






[315](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt315). Washington Post (9 May 1975). Paul takes care of this annoying fact as follows, in a letter to the Far Eastern Economic Review (9 December 1977): “I’m afraid that the evidence is overwhelming that these people, whoever they were, were either the rare exceptions or were not telling the truth,” appealing to the testimony of “scores of Cambodian refugees” most of whom “witnessed summary executions” and all of whom, to his recollection, saw “corpses during the long exodus”—as did some foreigners, though the more scrupulous among them pointed out that it was impossible to know whether they were victims of the recent bloody fighting or of executions. Ponchaud writes that he saw no dead bodies in or near Phnom Penh (Op. cit., p. 24).

See the Manchester Guardian Weekly (17 May 1975) and a brief report in the Washington Post (8 May 1975), which notes correctly that his account “lent no substance to reports that a massive and bloody purge of anti-Communists is under way in Cambodia.” He saw no bodies en route and found the streets of Phnom Penh empty on leaving the city. His report “was generally favorable to the Khmer Rouge,” and thus not to be discussed further.






[318](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt318). Recall that the second-hand report of the French teacher which they cite from Swain provides no evidence for the horrible consequences of summary executions that “virtually everybody” saw, but rather serves as an example of the “summary executions” themselves, furthermore, an example that does not support their conclusion, as noted.

[321](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt321). See note 2, above. Even “scoops” have been avoided by the press when they convey an unwanted picture. For example, in 1972 Serge Thion was invited to visit the liberated zones in Cambodia, reporting on his experiences in Le Monde (26, 27, 28 April 1972). His reports provided a unique insight into the character of an unknown, though evidently very successful and significant movement. His story was offered to the Washington Post, but rejected. It appeared nowhere in the U.S. media, to our knowledge. For some excerpts, see For Reasons of State, pp. 190ff.






[322](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt322). Several are cited in Hildebrand and Porter, in their ignored study.






[323](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt323). See, for example, the testimony of Peter Poole, May Hearings, pp. 18-19. He points out that “I don’t think there is a great deal we can do” to improve the situation though we might easily worsen it, and that even speaking out will do little good in this case. The point was commonly emphasized by people who know and care about Cambodia, as was the fact that the kind of irresponsible and sometimes hysterical “speaking out” that was being done, with its falsifications and unsupported allegations, could cause serious harm. See note 228 of this chapter, and the preface to this volume.






[324](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt324). Far easier, in fact. Throughout the protest against the U.S. war in Indochina, the Soviet Union was quite reluctant to back or tolerate strong condemnations of the United States, specifically of Nixon, a fact that led to continual controversy at international meetings.






[325](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt325). Not really “perfectly” because of the condemnation of the United States and the major theme that Khmer Rouge policies have roots and reason in the domestic society. But few will actually read the book, discovering these elements, and the commentary that reaches a mass audience can be counted on, by and large, to keep to atrocity stories. Lacouture takes note of the Western responsibility but ignores the second major theme of the book, as do other reviewers.

[327](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt327). William Shawcross, review of Cambodia: Year Zero, Inquiry, 16 October 1978.






[328](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt328). Economist, 1 July 1978.






[329](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt329). The Economist is correct, though not for the reasons it probably had in mind, in describing Lacouture’s published corrections as “a bizarre episode.” In what passes for intellectual discourse in the West, political discussion included, correction of errors is rare indeed, as a glance at review journals will indicate. Lacouture deserves credit for departing from the general norm. We think that his corrections are inadequate and disagree with some of the conclusions expressed in them, but we want to stress that it is no crime to misread—it is a rare review that avoids error—and it is only proper to issue corrections when errors are discovered. One of us (Chomsky) played a role in this, which though entirely a matter of private correspondence has for some reason been the subject of considerable discussion (and distortion) in the press. We see no point in commenting on any of this.






[330](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt330). The Economist thinks otherwise, for interesting reasons to which we return directly.






[331](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt331). See, e.g., Leo Cherne’s comment on the MacNeil/Lehrer Report, referring to Ponchaud as “very sympathetic to the Khmer Rouge.” See note 53. Similarly, the review in Foreign Affairs stresses that Ponchaud “was initially sympathetic to the Khmer Rouge” (Winter, 1978-1979), as have many others who take this alleged fact to add to the credibility of his account (reasonably, if it is true). Shawcross also writes that Ponchaud “originally welcomed the prospect of a revolutionary change” (New York Review, 6 April 1978). See also note 338.






[332](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt332). New York Review, 31 March 1977; thus he writes that he can read Ponchaud’s book “only with shame.”

[339](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt339). Lacouture’s original charges, in fact, have continued to circulate widely even after they were withdrawn. To cite only one case, Homer Jack, Secretary-General of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, produced a WCRP Report entitled “Can the United Nations stop human massacre in Democratic Kampuchea” (20 November 1978) which is full of fanciful charges, including Jean Lacouture’s estimate “of the number of persons killed” as “one-quarter of the population,” referring to Lacouture’s New York Review article in which he stated that the regime “boasted” of this achievement, but not to his “Corrections” where he stated that the charge had no basis. It is striking that the credible evidence of substantial atrocities never seems to suffice for human rights activists of this type. Jack surely knew of Lacouture’s corrections; indeed, in the course of a series of undocumented slanders directed at “the political right wing” and “the left wing,” he denounced our review in which the facts were mentioned. Even when the falsehood was specifically called to his attention, among many others in the document, he felt no need to correct it (or others). Recall Orwell’s statement on what is true “in the sight of God” in the Stalinist school of falsification; p. 196, above. The example is not untypical.

[345](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt345). New York Times (21 April 1975). The preceding sentence tells us that “the early American decisions on Indochina can be regarded as blundering efforts to do good. But by 1969...” See p. 17, above. More recently Lewis has warned that “America should do nothing” regarding Rhodesia, because, “if we remember Vietnam, we know that intervention, however well-intended, may do terrible harm if it is uninformed.” (New York Times, 1 February 1979). The inability of the intelligentsia to inform themselves about what their government is up to truly defies comment.






[346](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt346). Chomsky, letter, 1 June 1977.






[347](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt347). 12 May 1977.






[348](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt348). We know of only one case of honest retraction: Matthew Storin, Boston Globe (13 May 1977), correcting a report of 7 April based on Lacouture. Storin was also unique in his willingness to at least mention contrary evidence that was privately provided to journalists who had relied on Lacouture, along with conclusive evidence that their references were without basis. Alexander Cockburn expressed the hope—in vain—that “such liberal journalists as Lewis” who had relied on Lacouture’s derivative account would see “that ‘details’ do indeed matter” (Village Voice, 16 May 1977). After Lacouture’s corrections appeared, a letter was sent to the New York Review by a well-known scientist (Nobel Laureate) commenting that in his field, when conclusions are published based on certain evidence and it then turns out that the cited evidence is incorrect, the scientist does not retract the evidence while reiterating the conclusions—but evidently matters are different in journalism. The letter was not published.






[349](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt349). As we have mentioned (note 48), in the Nouvel Observateur, where Lacouture’s review was originally published, the corrections never appeared. But this fact, which we find rather surprising, is perhaps of little moment given that in the United States, where they did appear, they have been ignored and what remains in the media record are the original errors. A misstated reference by Lacouture to a quote that has been deleted from the American edition appears on the cover of the British edition of Ponchaud’s book. A different quote from Lacouture’s review appears on the cover of the American edition, with no concern over the fact that the conclusions expressed were based on no accurate citation. See note 339.






[350](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt350). Somewhat misleadingly. He writes that “My reference to the death of ‘one quarter’ of the population in a single year must be corrected”—he had spoken of “boasts” and killing—citing Ponchaud’s text, which gives a Cambodian estimate of 800,000 dead during the war and a U.S. embassy (Bangkok) estimate of 1.2 million dead (not killed) since the war; adding the two, we obtain the two million figure, about one quarter of the population, that has since been used with abandon in the press and Congress, very likely with this source. See note 293, above, on Ponchaud’s 1.2 million estimate allegedly based on “American embassy sources,’’ though the embassy offered no such estimate. Thus Lacouture’s statement that the Khmer Rouge boast of having eliminated some 2 million people is based on a misreading of a claim by Ponchaud that is dubious to begin with. Ponchaud mentions other estimates attributed to various vaguely-identified sources, but there is little reason to suppose that these claims have any more validity than the single one which is subject to check, and which, as is the way with verifiable claims, turns out to be inaccurate. Lacouture continues to refer to the 2 million figure (dropping the “boast”); “...the hundreds of thousands, indeed 2 million victims ...” of the Pol Pot Regime (Nouvel Observateur, 2 October 1978), an excerpt from his book Survive le peuple cambodgien! He gives no source, and does not explain how such charges will help the Cambodian people to survive.






[351](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt351). See pp. 72-73 of the French original, pp. 50-51 of the American translation.






[352](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt352). We do not know why Ponchaud dropped the quotes in the translation in this case. Perhaps because of the focus on the question after Lacouture’s review and corrections. Or perhaps the reason lies in a debate over translation from Khmer on which we are not competent to comment. In News from Kampuchea, August 1977, Stephen Heder challenged several of Ponchaud’s translations, including this one. He asserts that in this case, the correct translation of the Khmer phrase (which he says is openly used) is something like “to have no more of this kind of person (e.g., imperialists, oppressors).” In a privately circulated document (“Vicissitudes de la linguistique au service de l’Idéologie abstraite,” Ponchaud rejects these challenges to his translations. In this case he states that Heder’s proposed translation is “false,” but also says that his own translation was “hasty,” and would require more time to justify and polish. His own account of the meaning seems to us to leave the correct interpretation rather ambiguous over a certain range, with his specific formulation at the harsher extreme. In any event, even if there is a quote, contrary to what the American edition suggests, it would seem that Lacouture’s conclusions from a possible rhetorical flourish are distinctly questionable.






[353](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt353). The quote as Lacouture gives it in his Nouvel Observateur review is inaccurate, and further errors are introduced in the English translation. We will drop this matter, keeping to Ponchaud’s text.






[354](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt354). P. 73 of the French original.






[355](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt355). This translation, which is sufficiently accurate, is what appears in the British edition, p. 70.






[356](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt356). Heder provided us with an English translation; Ponchaud with a French translation and the Thai original.

[359](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt359). Cf. note 273, above. Also, note 82.






[360](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt360). There is a problem in that the French translation given in Ponchaud’s book differs from the French translation that he sent us, which includes the context omitted in the book. We will assume that the translation that he sent us is accurate. It corresponds closely to the English translation provided by Heder. We have not taken the trouble to verify the translations from the Thai original, since the main points emerge fairly clearly even without this further step.






[361](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt361). The phrase reads: “il peut même arriver qu’on n’y arrive pas partout, et les autorités se trouvent alors chargées d’un fardeau très lourd.”






[362](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt362). American edition, p. 51, a fair translation of the French text in Ponchaud’s book.






[363](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt363). This exercise in verification raises some further questions. It is striking that those passages in the original French text that drew attention because of Lacouture’s review have been softened, deleted, or changed in the American translation, or where they remain, are extremely misleading or outright misrepresentations. Note that this is true of each of the four cases just discussed, including the first, where a look at Ponchaud’s text shows that estimates of roughly a million dead (the most crucial of which lacks any credible source) become, a few lines later, allegations that many millions are being eliminated, most of the population in fact. These passages were selected for investigation at random, in effect; that is, they were not selected on any basis other than the fact that they seemed to be the passages that Lacouture had in mind in his misrepresentations of (i.e., references to) the book. The facts suggest some obvious questions about the remainder. We have not carried out a thorough line-by-line comparison but a fairly careful reading has not brought to light any other changes from the French original to the American translation (apart from some new material and some rearrangement). If this impression is correct, it also suggests obvious questions.











Ponchaud’s book is almost completely lacking in verifiable documentation. The Prachachat reference is one of a handful of examples. It is therefore of more than passing interest to see how it fares upon examination.

It has been alleged that Sihanouk was being hypocritical in his denunciation of the U.S. bombing and that he had in fact secretly authorized it. This has been occasionally argued in defense of the failure of the U.S. media, like Ponchaud, to make public Sihanouk’s impassioned criticism of the bombing of the civilian society of Cambodia. Two points deserve notice. First, even if Sihanouk secretly authorized bombing of “Vietcong bases,” he surely did not authorize bombing of Khmer peasants, and his protests were directed against the latter crime. Second, while commentators and media analysts may draw whatever conclusions they please from the conflicting evidence available, this does not entitle them to suppress what is, by any standards, crucial evidence, in this case, Sihanouk’s attempt to arouse international protest over the U.S. bombing of the civilian society.

[390](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt390). But given Ponchaud’s carelessness with fact, already noted in several cases, some caution is in order here as well. Thus, the author’s note to the American translation, dated 20 September 1977, contains a reference to a letter dated 19 October 1977.






[391](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt391). See note 352, above.






[392](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt392). We omit reference to other slight discrepancies.






[393](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt393). We have kept to published material, omitting discussion of personal correspondence mentioned by Ponchaud, who presumably obtained it from the editor of the New York Review. His references to this personal correspondence, apart from being irrelevant, are incorrect. What he calls “a polemical exchange” leading to Lacouture’s corrections consists of personal letters pointing out errors and urging correction; Lacouture’s published corrections reveal how little it was “polemical.” It is difficult to imagine a less polemical response to the discovery of serious errors, and it was so understood, as the correspondence clearly shows. Nor is there anything in this correspondence to support Ponchaud’s false statements, though even if there were, it would be irrelevant in this context, as should be obvious. We should perhaps mention that in his book cited above and in articles and interviews elsewhere, Lacouture has been presenting grossly false versions of Chomsky’s views, invariably without the slightest effort at documentation, and indeed, quite inconsistent with what he knows to be true. This too deserves no further comment.






[394](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt394). See note 329. Ponchaud’s fakery has also found its way into what purports to be “scholarship.” In a review of Ponchaud’s book in International Affairs, journal of the Royal Institute of International Affairs (January 1979), Dennis Duncanson writes that “The author reports, without rancour, that after the French edition came out it was attacked by Professor Noam Chomsky and Mr. Gareth Porter for relying on refugees’ stories, on the grounds that refugees can be assumed to warp the truth, that we ought to give the Phnom Penh Politburo the benefit of its secrecy, and that as a positive fact no massacres took place in Cambodia.” This is an embellishment of Ponchaud’s false statements in the British translation, presented here simply as fact—to this scholar, it is of no concern that Ponchaud’s charges are presented not only “without rancour” but also without a particle of evidence, and that, as can be easily verified, the charges are not only false but indeed were conscious falsehoods, as we have seen. Duncanson proceeds with further falsehoods and undocumented slanders that give some insight into what is regarded as “scholarship” in this domain but are otherwise not worthy of comment.

[399](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt399). Shawcross regards this question as not just serious, but the most crucial question, and he believes that the evidence has firmly established central direction and intent. See note 187, above, and text. In his published work, he appears to rely largely on Ponchaud, quite uncritically.






[400](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt400). Cambodia: Year Zero, p. xvi.






[401](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt401). The lapse on Ponchaud’s part is perhaps far from accidental. Thus in the British translation, the comparable passage in the author’s note (p. 16) clearly implies that the “accusing foreigners” are the ones to whom he has already referred: namely, Chomsky and Porter, who “say there have been no massacres” and regard refugees as “not a valid source,” an allegation that he knows perfectly well to be false, as we have seen.











Recall again that the British version is not available in the United States, where the merits of his allegations can readily be determined.






[402](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt402). Much the same is true of Ponchaud’s rhetorical question: “How many of those who say they are unreservedly in support of the Khmer revolution would consent to endure one hundredth part of the present sufferings of the Cambodian people” (p. 193), immediately following the familiar accusation that few voices have been “raised in protest against the assassination of a people.” He fails to enumerate those who are unreservedly in support of the Khmer revolution, though the list would be small enough so that it could easily have been given at this point. Note also that another question might easily be raised: how many of those who virulently condemn the Khmer revolution would consent to endure one hundredth part of the suffering of the peasants of the traditional society of Cambodia?—a society that was hardly improving their lot in its latter days.






[403](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt403). In fact, we know of no specialist who takes such an estimate seriously, including Ponchaud in his more sober moments.

[421](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt421). In the Watergate hearings the alleged “secrecy” of the bombing became an issue but not the bombing itself. Nixon’s crime, we must assume, was not that he sent his bombers to destroy a relatively peaceful country with which the United States had “friendly” relations, but that he kept the matter from Congress. On the hypocrisy of the Watergate proceedings and the press reaction quite generally, see Chomsky, introduction to Blackstock, ed., Cointelpro.






[422](../Text/Chapter6.html#Chapter6-Txt422). William Beecher, “Raids in Cambodia by U.S. unprotested,” New York Times (9 May 1969). Recall Ponchaud’s comment that Sihanouk’s protest against the bombing of North Vietnamese and Vietcong sanctuaries deceived no one. As we pointed out in note 370, Sihanouk’s protests were primarily against the bombing of Khmer civilians. In regard to the bombing of Vietnamese concentrations near the border, while there is conflicting evidence as to Sihanouk’s attitude, it is not up to the press or others to decide what it “really was” and then to withhold reference to his explicit appeal just cited on grounds that no one is deceived by it. What is more, recall that the bombings of the “Vietcong and North Vietnamese” sanctuaries were undoubtedly aimed at Vietnamese who had been driven across the border by murderous U.S. military operations in Vietnam, primarily since early 1967. And finally, recall that direct observation by Western reporters and others confirms that the B-52 raids were by no means aimed at the Vietnamese. See for example, Swain, op. cit.; p. 284-85, above. While the precise scale of these atrocities could not have been known in 1969, and is not known now in the West, a free press could have surmised and perhaps learned a great deal had it chosen to do so. It is remarkable that Beecher’s unique though quite inadequate account is now held up as evidence that the press maintained its honor throughout this period, despite the crimes of Richard Nixon.
