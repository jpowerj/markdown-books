William Blum left the State Department in 1967, abandoning his aspiration of becoming a Foreign Service Officer, because of his opposition to what the United States was doing in Vietnam.

He then became one of the founders and editors of the *Washington Free Press*, the first "underground" newspaper in the capital.

In 1969, he wrote and published an expos√© of the CIA in which was revealed the names and addresses of more than 200 employees of the Agency.

Mr. Blum has been a freelance journalist in the United States, Europe and South America. His stay in Chile in 1972-3, writing about the Allende government's "socialist experiment", and then its tragic overthrow in a CIA-designed coup, instilled in him a personal involvement and an even more heightened interest in what his government was doing in various corners of the world.

In the mid-1970's, he worked in London with former CIA officer Philip Agee and his associates on their project of exposing CIA personnel and their misdeeds.

The late 1980s found Mr. Blum living in Los Angeles pursuing a career as a screenwriter. Unfortunately, his screenplays all had two (if not three) strikes against them because they dealt with those things which make grown men run screaming in Hollywood: ideas and issues.

In 1999, he was one of the recipients of Project Censored's awards for "exemplary journalism" for writing one of the top ten censored stories of 1998, an article on how, in the 1980s, the United States gave Iraq the material to develop a chemical and biological warfare capability.

Blum's articles have appeared in *The Ecologist*, Z *Magazine, Covert Action Quarterly, Counterpunch, Lobster, National Catholic Reporter, The Progressive, the San Francisco Chronicle* and other publications.

He is also the author of: *Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower* (2000), *West-Bloc Dissident: A Cold War Memoir* (2002), and *Freeing the World to Death: Essays on the American Empire* (2004). His books have been translated into 17 foreign languages, comprising 27 different foreign-language editions.

In Janaury 2006, a tape from Osama bin Laden stated that "it would be useful" for Americans to read "Rogue State" to gain a better understanding of their enemy.

Blum currently sends out a monthly newsletter, the Anti-Empire Report. To be put on Blum's mailing list, send hm an email. Previous issues of the report can be read on his website.
