## U.S. Government Assassination Plots

On June 26, 1993, the United States carried out a bombing attack on Iraq in retaliation for an alleged Iraqi plot to assassinate former president George Bush. The attack, said President Clinton, "was essential to send a message to those who engage in state-sponsored terrorism ... and to affirm the expectation of civilized behavior among nations."

Following is a list of prominent foreign individuals whose assassination (or planning for same) the United States has been involved in since the end of the Second World War. The list does not include several assassinations in various parts of the world carried out by anti-Castro Cubans employed by the CIA and headquartered in the United States.
